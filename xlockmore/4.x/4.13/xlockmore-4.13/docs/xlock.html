DESCRIPTION
     xlock locks the X server till the user enters their password
     at  the  keyboard.   While  xlock is running, all new server
     connections are refused.  The screen saver is disabled.  The
     mouse  cursor  is  turned  off.  The screen is blanked and a
     changing pattern is put on the screen.  If a key or a  mouse
     button is pressed then the user is prompted for the password
     of the user who started xlock.

     If the  correct  password  is  typed,  then  the  screen  is
     unlocked  and  the  X  server  is restored.  When typing the
     password Control-U and Control-H  are  active  as  kill  and
     erase  respectively.   To return to the locked screen, click
     in the small icon version of the changing pattern.

     In  the  lower  part  of  the  password  screen  a  text  is
     displayed.  This message is taken from the first file of the
     following that exists:   $HOME/.xlocktext,  $HOME/.plan,  or
     $HOME/.signature.

     On systems which support new BSD style  authentication,  the
     password may be prefixed by an authentication style followed
     by a colon (i.e. "style:password").  See  the  login.conf(5)
     for more information on authentication styles.


NOTE ON ETIQUETTE
     <EM>Xlock</EM> should not be used on public terminals when there is a
     high demand for them.

     If you find a  public  terminal  that  has  been  locked  by
     another user and there are no other terminals available, and
     the terminal appears to have been  left  idle  for  a  while
     (normally  more than 15 minutes), it is fair to try to reset
     the session in some manner.

     -delay <EM>usecs</EM>
          The <EM>delay</EM> option sets the speed at which  a  mode  will
          operate.   It simply sets the number of microseconds to
          delay between batches of animations.  In blank mode, it
          is  important  to  set  this  to  some  small number of
          seconds,  because  the  keyboard  and  mouse  are  only
          checked  after  each delay, so you cannot set the delay
          too high, but a delay of zero would needlessly  consume
          cpu  checking  for  mouse and keyboard input in a tight
          loop, since blank mode has no work to do.

          gles in deco, size of the polygon in crystal,  size  of
          polyhedron  in  ico,  size of lissie in lissie, size of
          dots of flag, for kaleid it is the symmetry,  width  of

          dilemma,  life,  life1d, pacman, tetris, voters, wator,
          and wire.  In pipes it is the maximum length of a  sys-
          tem.   In atlantis it is the shark size.  In sproingies
          it is the size of the screen.  A negative number allows
          for randomness, similar to <EM>count</EM>.

     -ncolors <EM>num</EM>
          The <EM>ncolors</EM> option sets the maximum number of colors to
          be used.

     -saturation <EM>value</EM>
          The <EM>saturation</EM> option sets saturation of the color ramp
          used  to  <EM>value</EM>  .  0  is  grayscale and 1 is very rich
          color.  0.4 is a nice pastel.

     -erasemode <EM>modename</EM>
          As of this writing there are over 9  erase  modes  sup-
          ported  (if  its  not  chosen its assumed random).  The
          erase modes are random_lines, random_squares, venetian,
          triple_wipe, quad_wipe, circle_wipe, three_circle_wipe,
          squaretate, no_fade.

     -erasedelay <EM>usecs</EM>
          The <EM>erasedelay</EM> option sets the number  of  microseconds
          for  steps  of  the  erasemode  (a setting of 0 and the
          erasemode is bypassed).

     +/-nolock
          The <EM>nolock</EM> option causes xlock to only  draw  the  pat-
          terns and not lock the display.  A key press or a mouse
          click will terminate the screen saver.

     -/+inwindow
          Runs xlock in a window, so that you can iconify,  move,
          or resize it and still use your screen for other stuff.
          When running in a window, xlock no  longer  locks  your
          screen, it just looks good.

     -/+inroot
          Runs xlock in your  root  window.   Like  the  <EM>inwindow</EM>
          option  it  no  longer  locks the screen, it just looks
          good.

     -/+remote
          The <EM>remote</EM> option tells xlock  to  not  stop  you  from
          locking remote X11 servers.  This option should be used
          with care and is intended mainly to lock X11  terminals
          which  cannot  run  xlock locally.  If you lock someone
          else's workstation, they will have to know  your  pass-
          word   to  unlock  it.   Using  +<EM>remote</EM>  overrides  any
          resource derived values for <EM>remote</EM> and  prevents  xlock
          from  being  used  to lock other X11 servers.  (Use `+'
          instead of `-' to override resources for other  options
          that can take the `+' modifier similarly.)

     -/+mono
          The <EM>mono</EM> option causes  xlock  to  display  monochrome,
          (black  and  white)  pixels  rather  than  the  default
          colored ones on color displays.

     -/+allowaccess
          This option is required for servers which do not  allow
          clients  to modify the host access control list.  It is
          also useful if you need to run x clients  on  a  server
          which is locked for some reason...  When <EM>allowaccess</EM> is
          true, the X11 server is left open for clients to attach
          and  thus  lowers  the  inherent  security of this lock
          screen.  A side effect of using this option is that  if
          xlock  is  killed -KILL, the access control list is not
          lost.

     -vtlock <EM>modename</EM>
          This option is used on a XFree86 system  to  manage  VT
          switching in [off|noswitch|switch|restore] mode.

     <EM>off</EM>       means no VT switch locking.

     <EM>switch</EM>    means VT switch locking + switching  to  xlock  VT
               when activated.

     <EM>restore</EM>   means VT switch locking + switching  to  xlock  VT
               when  activated  +  switching  back to previous VT
               when desactivated.

     <EM>noswitch</EM>  means VT switch locking  only  when  xlock  VT  is
               active.

     -/+allowroot
          The <EM>allowroot</EM> option allows the root password to unlock
          the  server as well as the user who started xlock.  May
          not be able to turn this on and off depending  on  your
          system and how xlock was configured.

     -/+debug
          Allows xlock to be debugged by doing  all  but  locking
          the screen.

     -/+description
          The  <EM>description</EM>  option  causes  xlock  shows  a  mode
          description  above  password window.  The default is to
          show this description.

     -/+echokeys
          The <EM>echokeys</EM> option causes xlock to echo '?' characters
          for each key typed into the password prompt.  Some con-
          sider this a security risk, so the default  is  to  not
          echo anything.

     -/+enablesaver
          By default xlock will disable  the  normal  X  server's
          screen  saver  since  it is in effect a replacement for
          it.  Since it is possible to set delay parameters  long
          enough  to  cause  phosphor burn on some displays, this
          option will turn back on the default screen saver which
          is very careful to keep most of the screen black.

     -/+resetsaver
          By default xlock will call XResetScreenSaver.  This may
          be undesirable with DPMS monitors.

     -/+grabmouse
          The <EM>grabmouse</EM> option causes xlock to grab the mouse and
          keyboard,  this is the default.  xlock can not lock the
          screen without this.

     -/+grabserver
          The <EM>grabserver</EM> option causes xlock to grab the  server.
          This  is not usually needed but some unsecure X servers
          can be defeated without this.

     -/+install
          Allows xlock to install its own colormap if xlock  runs
          out  of  colors.   May  not  work  on  with some window
          managers (fvwm) and does  not  work  with  the  -inroot
          option.

     -/+mousemotion
          Allows you to turn on and off the  sensitivity  to  the
          mouse to bring up the password window.

     -/+sound
          Allows you to turn on and off sound if  installed  with
          the capability.

     -/+timeelapsed
          Allows you to find out how long a machine is locked  so
          you  can  complain  to an administrator that someone is
          hogging a machine.

     -/+usefirst
          The <EM>usefirst</EM> option causes xlock to use  the  keystroke
          which got you to the password screen as the first char-
          acter in the password.  The default is  to  ignore  the
          first key pressed.

     -/+verbose
          Verbose mode, tells what options it is going to use.

     -nice <EM>nicelevel</EM>
          The <EM>nice</EM> option sets system nicelevel of the xlock pro-
          cess to <EM>nicelevel</EM> .

     -lockdelay <EM>seconds</EM>
          The <EM>lockdelay</EM> option sets the number of <EM>seconds</EM>  before
          the  screen  needs a password to be unlocked.  Good for
          use with an autolocking mechanism like xautolock(1).

     -timeout <EM>seconds</EM>
          The <EM>timeout</EM> option sets the number  of  <EM>seconds</EM>  before
          the password screen will time out.

     -font <EM>fontname</EM>
          The <EM>font</EM> option sets the font to be used on the  prompt
          screen.

     -planfont <EM>fontname</EM>
          option sets the font to be used for the  text  that  is
          displayed in the lower part of the password screen.

     -fg <EM>color</EM>
          The <EM>fg</EM> option sets the color of the text on  the  pass-
          word screen to <EM>color</EM> .

     -bg <EM>color</EM>
          The <EM>bg</EM> option sets the color of the background  on  the
          password screen to <EM>color</EM> .

     -foreground <EM>color</EM>
          The <EM>foreground</EM> option sets the color of the text on the
          password screen to <EM>color</EM> .

     -background <EM>color</EM>
          The <EM>background</EM> option sets the color of the  background
          on the password screen to <EM>color</EM> .

     -username <EM>string</EM>
          Text <EM>string</EM> is shown in front of user name, defaults to
          "Name: ".

     -password <EM>string</EM>
          Text <EM>string</EM> is the password prompt string, defaults  to
          "Password: ".

     -info <EM>string</EM>
          Text <EM>string</EM> is an informational  message  to  tell  the
          user what to do, defaults to "Enter password to unlock;
          select icon to lock.".

     -validate <EM>string</EM>
          Text <EM>string</EM> is a message  shown  while  validating  the
          password, defaults to "Validating login..."

     -invalid <EM>string</EM>
          Text  <EM>string</EM>  is  a  message  shown  when  password  is
          invalid, defaults to "Invalid login."

     -geometry <EM>geom</EM>
          The <EM>geometry</EM> option sets <EM>geom</EM> the size  and  offset  of
          the  lock  window  (normally  the  entire screen).  The
          entire screen format is still  used  for  entering  the
          password.  The purpose is to see the screen even though
          it is locked.  This should be used with  caution  since
          many of the modes will fail if the windows are far from
          square or are too small  (size  must  be  greater  than
          0x0).   This  should  also be used with -enablesaver to
          protect screen from phosphor burn.

     -icongeometry <EM>geom</EM>
          The <EM>icongeometry</EM> option  sets  <EM>geom</EM>  the  size  of  the
          iconic  screen  (normally 64x64) seen when entering the
          password.  This should be used with caution since  many
          of  the  modes  will  fail  if the windows are far from
          square or are too small  (size  must  be  greater  than
          0x0).   The  greatest size is 256x256.  There should be
          some limit so  users  could  see  who  has  locked  the
          screen.  Position information of icon is ignored.

     -glgeometry <EM>geom</EM>
          The <EM>glgeometry</EM> option sets <EM>geom</EM> the size of the  screen
          for gl modes.  Not normally available or needed.

     -/+fullrandom

     -right3d <EM>color</EM>
          Color used for right eye in 3d mode.

     -left3d <EM>color</EM>
          Color used for left eye in 3d mode.

     -both3d <EM>color</EM>
          Color used for overlapping images for  left  and  right
          eye in 3d mode.

     -program <EM>programname</EM>
          The <EM>program</EM> option sets the program to be used  as  the
          fortune generator.  Currently used only for marquee and
          nose modes.

     -messagesfile <EM>formatted</EM>-<EM>filename</EM>
          The <EM>messagesfile</EM> option sets the file to be used as the
          fortune  generator.   The  first entry is the number of
          fortunes, the next line  contains  the  first  fortune.
          Fortunes  begin  with  a  "%%"  on  a  line  by itself.
          Currently used only for marquee and nose modes.  If one
          exists, it takes precedence over the fortune program.

     -messagefile <EM>filename</EM>
          The <EM>messagefile</EM> option sets the file whose contents are
          displayed.   Currently  used  only for marquee and nose
          modes.  If one exists, it  takes  precedence  over  the
          fortune program and messagesfile.

     -message <EM>textstring</EM>
          The <EM>message</EM> option sets the text to be displayed  in  a
          mode.   Currently  used only for flag, marquee and nose
          modes.  If one exists, it  takes  precedence  over  the
          fortune program, messagesfile and message.

     -messagefont <EM>fontname</EM>
          The <EM>messagefont</EM> option sets the font to be used in  the
          mode.   Currently used only for flag, marquee, and nose
          modes.

     -bitmap <EM>filename</EM>
          The <EM>bitmap</EM> option sets the xbm, xpm, or ras file to  be
          displayed with flag, image, life, life1d, maze, or puz-
          zle mode.  For eyes and  pacman  only  a  xbm  file  is
          accepted.  Certain modes reject the bitmap if too big.

     -neighbors <EM>num</EM>
          The <EM>neighbors</EM> option sets the number of neighbors of  a
          cell  to  3,  4,  6,  9 (may not have real mathematical
          meaning), or 12 for several automata modes.  Setting it
          to 0 typically randomizes this, except in life where it
          is set to 8.

     -/+mouse
          Turn on and off mouse interaction in <EM>eyes</EM>,  <EM>julia</EM>,  <EM>and</EM>
          <EM>swarm</EM>.


MORE OPTIONS (these may not be available)

          The <EM>forceLogout</EM> option sets <EM>minutes</EM> to auto-logout.

     -logoutButtonLabel <EM>string</EM>
          Text <EM>string</EM> is a message  shown  inside  logout  button
          when logout button is displayed.  Defaults to "Logout".

     -logoutButtonHelp <EM>string</EM>
          Text <EM>string</EM> is a message shown  outside  logout  button
          when  logout  button  is displayed.  Defaults to "Click

          Turn on/off CDE Saver Mode.  This option is only avail-
          able if CDE support was compiled in.

     -modulepath <EM>path</EM>
          The <EM>modulepath</EM> option sets the <EM>directories</EM>  that  xlock
          searches  for  mode  modules  to  load.   It is a colon
          separated list of directories to  search.  If  "%S"  is
          included  in  the  path,  it is replaced by the default
          modulepath.  To add a private module directory  to  the
          default  path, use something like '%S:~/mymoduledir' as
          the path.  This option is only available if module sup-
          port was compiled in.

     -locksound <EM>string</EM>
          Text <EM>string</EM> references  sound  to  use  at  lock  time.

          Allows one to set <EM>life</EM> survival and  birth  parameters.
          For  example, Conway's rule is S23/B3.  Special parame-
          ters: P, picks a random rule from all rules  that  have
          known  patterns;  G, picks a random rule from all rules
          that have known gliders.

     -lifefile <EM>filename</EM>
          The <EM>lifefile</EM> option sets the lifeform.  Only one format
          is currently supported, the #P xlife format.

          <EM>life</EM>.

     -/+totalistic
          Turn on and off totalistic rules for <EM>life1d</EM>. If this is
          off  then  it  follows  rules  of  the LCAU collection.
          These rules may not be symmetric and are more general.

     -rule3d <EM>S</EM>&lt;<EM>neighborhood</EM>&gt;/<EM>B</EM>&lt;<EM>neighborhood</EM>&gt;
          Allows one to set <EM>life3d</EM> survival and birth parameters.
          For  example,  Bay's  rules are S45/B5, S567/B6 S56/B5,
          and S67/B67.  There is currently no  way  of  accessing
          neighborhoods beyond 9.  Special parameters: P, picks a
          random rule from all rules that have known patterns; G,
          picks  a  random  rule  from  all rules that have known
          gliders.

     -life3dfile <EM>filename</EM>
          The <EM>life3dfile</EM> option sets the lifeform.  Only one for-
          mat  is  currently  supported,  similar to the #P xlife
          format.  2 linefeeds in a row are  assumed  to  advance
          the depth.

          on,  <EM>cycles</EM>  is  divided by 64 to compute the number of
          lines, so as to be compatible when using -fullrandom.

     -factory <EM>num</EM>
          Number of extra factory parts in <EM>pipes</EM>.

     -/+fisheye
          Turn on if you want a zoomed-in view of <EM>pipes</EM>.

          the time in <EM>star</EM>.

     -/+rock
          Turn on and off rocks for <EM>star</EM>. If this is  off,  stars
          will be seen instead.

     -/+straight
          Turn on if <EM>star</EM> gets you motion sick.

     -cyclepeed <EM>num</EM>

          Allows one to set a duration  for  a  mode  in  <EM>random</EM>.
          Duration of 0 is defined as infinite.

     -modelist <EM>textstring</EM>
          Allows one to pass a list of files to randomly  display
          to <EM>random</EM>. "all" will get all files but blank (and bomb
          if  compiled  in).  "all,blank"  will  get  all  modes.
          "all,-image bounce,+blank" will get all modes but image
          and bounce.  "bug wator" will get only bug  and  wator.
          "allgl"  will  get  only  the  GL modes if compiled in,
          all-allgl will get all but the GL modes, "allnice" will
          weed  out  high cpu usage modes (as well as hackers and
          gl modes).  "allxpm" will get all modes that  use  xpm.
          "allwrite"  will  get  all modes that take advantage of
          writable colormaps (not including xpm).   "all3d"  will
          get all the modes that support this option.  "allmouse"
          will get all the modes that support mouse  interaction.
          Similarly,  "allautomata" for automata modes, "allfrac-
          tal" for  fractal  modes,  "allgeometry"  for  geometry
          modes,  "allspace"  for  space  modes.  The random mode
          itself can not be referenced.

     -/+sequential
          Turn on non-random <EM>random</EM> option.


**WARNING**
     xlock can appear to hang if it is  competing  with  a  high-
     priority  process  for  the  CPU.  For  example, if xlock is
     started after a process with  'nice  -20'  (high  priority),
     xlock will take  considerable amount of time to respond.


SHADOW PASSWORDS
     If the machine is using a shadow password system, then xlock
     may  not  be  set up to get the real password and so must be
     given one of its own. This can  be  either  on  the  command
     line,   via   the   -cpasswd   option,   or   in   the  file
     $HOME/.xlockrc, with the first taking precedence.   In  both
     cases  an  encrypted  password is expected (see makekey(8)).
     If neither is given, then xlock will prompt for  a  password
     and  will  use that, also storing an encrypted version of it
     in $HOME/.xlockrc for future use.

BUGS
     "kill -KILL xlock " causes the server that was locked to  be
     unusable, since all hosts (including localhost) were removed
     from the access control list to lock out new X clients,  and
     since  xlock  could  not catch SIGKILL, it terminated before
     restoring the access control list.  This will  leave  the  X
     server  in  a state where "<EM>you</EM> <EM>can</EM> <EM>no</EM> <EM>longer</EM> <EM>connect</EM> <EM>to</EM> <EM>that</EM>
     <EM>server</EM>, <EM>and</EM> <EM>this</EM> <EM>operation</EM> <EM>cannot</EM>  <EM>be</EM>  <EM>reversed</EM>  <EM>unless</EM>  <EM>you</EM>
     <EM>reset</EM>  <EM>the</EM> <EM>server</EM>."            -From the X11R4 Xlib Documen-
     tation, Chapter 7.
     NCD terminals do not allow xlock to  remove  all  the  hosts
     from  the  access  control list.  Therefore you will need to
     use the "-remote" and "-allowaccess" switches.  If you  hap-
     pen  to run without "-allowaccess" on an NCD terminal, xlock
     will not work and you will need to reboot the  terminal,  or
     simply  go into the SETUP menus, under 'Network Parameters',
     and turn off TCP/IP access control.
