This is for getting xlockmore modes running in xscreensaver-2.16.
xlockmore-modes will install first ...
So during an installation these executables will be overwritten
if there is a conflict with the xscreensavers modes.

See docs/TODO for current problems.

0. OK say you have xscreensaver-2.16/ .  Define the full path to and
   including this directory $XS) drop xlockmore in that directory
   change the name of xlockmore to "xlockmore".
   (This is not 100% tested so it would be wise to read it first!)


1. Makefile.in replaces $XS/Makefile.in
   configure.in replaces $XS/configure.in
   need autoconf to replace configure... (pick it from your favorite gnu site)
Recommend action...
-------------------
  mv $XS/configure.in $XS/configure.in.orig
  mv $XS/Makefile.in $XS/Makefile.in.orig
  cp ./configure.in $XS/configure.in
  cp ./Makefile.in $XS/Makefile.in
  ksh
  cd $XS
  autoconf
  exit


2. modes/glx directory goes in xscreensaver/hacks/glx with the old
   Makefile.in (do not write over this file!) and xlock-gl.c

Recommend action...
-------------------
  mv $XS/hacks/glx $XS/hacks/glx.orig
  cp -R ../modes/glx $XS/hacks/glx
  cp $XS/hacks/glx.orig/Makefile.in $XS/hacks/glx/
  cp $XS/hacks/glx.orig/xlock-gl.c $XS/hacks/glx/


3. change Makefiles... backups (.inxl) files should already be there.

Recommend action...
-------------------
  cp ../xlock/Makefile.inxs ../xlock/Makefile.in
  cp ../modes/Makefile.inxs ../modes/Makefile.in


4. Remove a file that will trip me up (probably not necessary now)

Recommend action...
-------------------
  mv $XS/hacks/xlock.h xlock.h.oldandintheway


5. Then its all ready...
  cd $XS
  configure
  make
