  xxlloocckk  locks the X server till the user enters their pass­
  word at the keyboard.  While xxlloocckk  is  running,  all  new
  server  connections are refused.  The screen saver is dis­
  abled.  The mouse cursor is turned  off.   The  screen  is
  blanked and a changing pattern is put on the screen.  If a
  key or a mouse button is pressed then the user is prompted
  for the password of the user who started xxlloocckk.

  If  the  correct  password  is  typed,  then the screen is
  unlocked and the X server is restored.   When  typing  the
  password  Control-U  and  Control-H are active as kill and
  erase respectively.  To return to the locked screen, click
  in the small icon version of the changing pattern.

  _X_l_o_c_k should not be used on public terminals when there is
  a high demand for them.

  If  you  find  a  public  terminal that has been locked by
  another user and there are no other  terminals  available,
  and  the  terminal  appears  to  have been left idle for a
  while (normally more than 15 minutes), it is fair  to  try
  to reset the session in some manner.

  --ddeellaayy _u_s_e_c_s
       The _d_e_l_a_y option sets the speed at which a mode  will
       operate.   It  simply sets the number of microseconds
       to delay between batches  of  animations.   In  blank
       mode,  it is important to set this to some small num­
       ber of seconds, because the keyboard  and  mouse  are
       only  checked after each delay, so you cannot set the
       delay too high, but a delay of zero would  needlessly
       consume  cpu checking for mouse and keyboard input in
       a tight loop, since blank mode has no work to do.

       Runs  xxlloocckk  in  your root window.  Like the _i_n_w_i_n_d_o_w
       option it no longer locks the screen, it  just  looks
       good.

  --//++rreemmoottee
       The  _r_e_m_o_t_e  option  tells xxlloocckk to not stop you from
       locking remote X11 servers.  This  option  should  be
       used  with  care  and  is intended mainly to lock X11
       terminals which cannot run  xxlloocckk  locally.   If  you
       lock  someone  else's  workstation, they will have to
       know yyoouurr password to unlock it.  Using _+_r_e_m_o_t_e over­
       rides any resource derived values for _r_e_m_o_t_e and pre­
       vents  xxlloocckk  from  being  used  to  lock  other  X11
       servers.    (Use  `+'  instead  of  `-'  to  override
       resources for other options that  can  take  the  `+'
       modifier similarly.)

  --//++mmoonnoo
       The  _m_o_n_o  option causes xxlloocckk to display monochrome,
       (black and white) pixels rather than the default col­
       ored ones on color displays.

  --//++aalllloowwaacccceessss
       This  option  is  required  for  servers which do not
       allow clients to modify the host access control list.
       It  is  also useful if you need to run x clients on a
       server which  is  locked  for  some  reason...   When
       _a_l_l_o_w_a_c_c_e_s_s  is true, the X11 server is left open for
       clients to attach and thus lowers the inherent  secu­
       rity  of  this  lock  screen.  A side effect of using
       this option is that if xxlloocckk  is  killed  -KILL,  the
       access control list is not lost.

  --//++vvttlloocckk
       This  option is used on a XFree86 system to manage VT
       switching...  When _v_t_l_o_c_k is true, the  VT  switching
       is disabled.

  --//++aalllloowwrroooott
       The  _a_l_l_o_w_r_o_o_t  option  allows  the  root password to
       unlock the server as well as  the  user  who  started
       xxlloocckk.   May  not  be  able  to  turn this on and off
       depending on your system and how  xxlloocckk  was  config­
       ured.

  --//++ddeebbuugg

       By  default  xxlloocckk will disable the normal X server's
       screen saver since it is in effect a replacement  for
       it.   Since  it  is  possible to set delay parameters
       long enough to cause phosphor burn on some  displays,
       this  option  will  turn  back  on the default screen
       saver which is very  careful  to  keep  most  of  the

       server.  This is not usually needed but some unsecure
       X servers can be defeated without this.

  --//++iinnssttaallll

       the  lock  window  (normally the entire screen).  The
       entire screen format is still used for  entering  the

       are far from square or are too small  (size  must  be
       greater  than  0x0).   This  should also be used with

       many  of  the  modes will fail if the windows are far
       from square or are too small (size  must  be  greater

  If the machine is using a  shadow  password  system,  then
  xxlloocckk  may  not  be set up to get the real password and so
  must be given one of its own. This can be  either  on  the

  $$HHOOMMEE//..xxlloocckkrrcc, with the first taking precedence.  In both
  cases  an encrypted password is expected (see makekey(8)).
  If neither is given, then xxlloocckk will prompt for a password
  and will use that, also storing an encrypted version of it

  NCD terminals do not allow xlock to remove all  the  hosts
  from  the access control list.  Therefore you will need to
  use the "-remote" and  "-allowaccess"  switches.   If  you
  happen  to  run without "-allowaccess" on an NCD terminal,
  xxlloocckk will not work and you will need to reboot the termi­
  nal,  or  simply  go  into the SETUP menus, under 'Network
