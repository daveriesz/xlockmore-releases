General problems:
  o I got an error with moebius running it on opengl on a 24 bit TrueColor like:
    xlock -mode moebius -visual PseudoColor
    (all the gl modes are messed up anyway... all mono)

  o some configurations of linux: swarm has noise when bees go beyond screen

  o It would be nice to have an option -idletime time.  Where xlock would
   run after a certain idle time.  (Here xautolock may help you, see
   above).

  o A few unintialized memory reads and memory leaks were detected in some
   of the code.  grep for "PURIFY" in the source files to see where the
   remaining problems are.  Also see docs/Purify for more details. 

  o -inwindow not correct for multiscreens, there should only be one
   window.

  o -mono does not work for XPM, especially cartoon (others use XBM when
   mono), also cage and stairs.

  o Options within a mode can not be duplicated in other modes.  Temporary
   solution is to have xlock modes like "-neighbor" that only a few of the
   modes use.

  o -use3d -install is messed up on Sun's PseudoColor.  Magenta boxes are
   seen on the star mode.  In worm mode, worms might be red and magenta
   instead of red blue (and depending on SunCC or SunOS).

  o Not all resources are listed in "xlock -resources", e.g. nolock.
   If xlock is renamed these resources are not picked up.

  o Without any programs stealing your colors, like netscape
   xlock -modelist all -sequential -install -verbose
   Hit the middle button a hundred times (not to bad on an ultra actually)
   or try -duration 1 and let it sit for a while.
   The second time it runs the GL modes they have all lost some colors.
   This was only noticed on Solaris with pseudocolor.  Also noticed on an
   ancient HP9000/380 HPUX9.0 with 6 bit depth (without netscape).

  o On a German keyboard and Linux if the password contains special
   characters (`|' vertical bar, `@' at-sign) while in debug mode
   everything works fine. This probably has something to do with the
   X11-keymapping, as these characters are composed with the right Alt-key
   on a German keyboard. 

  o neighbors option for wator and voters... sometimes circles are not
   drawn in the correct spot.  A -/+ wrap option would be nice also.

  o OpenGL and DT may be incompatible on PseudoColor.  (MesaGL should be
   OK.)  OpenGL frequently causes xlock to error out on non-default visuals.

  o -visual DirectColor if used with any of the with the writeable modes
   (mandelbrot, swirl, or tube) may corrupt the dynamic allocation of memory.

  o Errors in modes, if any, should not break lock.

  o Compile-time option to allow running of separate processes.

  o Fallback font if screen is small for marquee and nose... like bomb

  o make -n install prefix=/foo/bar does not work.
  
  o XLock.life1d.imagefile: ./bitmaps/    <---Does not work with
   xlock -modelist life1d,life -mode random
   could not read file "./bitmaps/"
   and this does:
   xlock -modelist life1d,life -mode random -imagefile ./bitmaps/
    (or xlock -modelist life1d,life -mode random with
     XLock.random.imagefile: ./bitmaps/  This takes priority.) 

  o "xlock -mode random -modelist image,puzzle -imagefile ~/xlock/images/"
   It should change images when middle mouse is pushed or when
   -duration time runs out.

  o jpeg/gif/animated gif support  Fix ras for > 8 bit TrueColor

  o "-visual" commandline argument should accept "best" as well as
   PseudoColor, TrueColor, default, etc.

  o modes from xscreensaver :) : bubbles, moire, LMorph, halo, ImsMap, BlitSpin


Mode specific problems:
----------------------
  Various modes need better refresh capability.
  Various modes need more mouse capability like pacman and worm.

  ball: can it be updated to use a pixmap instead of a slow circle fill?

  braid: should be made so that it can be interrupted quicker.

  bouboule: always starts at the bottom right

  bounce:
    sometimes a ball does not roll off another ball.
    momentum seems to be created.
    A -wall option, multiscreens should have balls bouncing between
      screens.
    -mode bounce -inroot may give BadWindow in X_GetWindowAttributes
      if run for a while, but the screen is not locked :)
    allow a background picture to be seen behind the bouncing football
      (soccer ball) in "bounce" mode.  Thus a picture of your favorite
      team, etc. can be seen behind the bouncing balls.
    football version of "bounce" using a pigskin instead of a soccer ball for
      Americans/Canadians/etc.
    Different balls with different mass and size.

  bug:
    -neighbors option
    init_bug should be broken up so it can be interrupted

  ico:
    should have all the features of the original.
    triangular face objects do not look good when rotated.

  image: middle button should do something when called like
     "-imagefile ./bitmap/"

  flag:
    sometimes a refresh causes a white background rectangle 

  hop: center and size many of the hops.

  kaleid: needs to be triangular.

  life: -find option to find new lifeforms.  (mail the results out :) ).
    Allow more symmetric type rules as proposed by Dr. Andreen.

  life3d: draws invisible cubes when it does not have to.  The original
    MS DOS code weeded this out, but it did not seem to port to X.
    Also see life.

  marquee:
    "-messagefile filename" truncates a large file.
    "-message string" does not handle Control-H correctly.

  mountain: -size # for mountain should do something.

  nose: should handle Control-H better for underlining and accents.

  pyro: needs XDrawSegments code similar to swarm to give it depth.

  slip:
    should be less jarring
    get rid of single color blotch.
    should be made so that it can be interrupted quicker.

  star:
    fractal cracks when hit by rocks (with sound?)
    user defined ships (user defined pixmaps like eyes and pacman).
    stars should look more star-like "*"'s

  wire:  it needs a better circuit generator.

  xmlock, xalock: need a portable way of handling kill.

  xglock:  Needs a lot of work.
  
  kscreensaver:  port xlock to KDE.


New mode ideas... (some may be very hard :) ):
---------------------------------------------
  o "dead" a Grateful Dead mode with dancing bears/skeletons/turtles.
      (Or maybe "nose" in a tie die?)
  o "floyd" a Pink Floyd mode from the cover of "Dark Side of the Moon"
      with a turning  prism and rainbow effect.
  o "graph" a random planar graph drawn ... filled in by a 5 (or 4 :) )
      coloring algorithm.
  o "invert" a demonstration of turning a sphere inside out without creating
      any kinks (two surfaces can occupy the same space at the same time).
      Randomize the viewing angle.
  o "minimal" a random minimal surface generator.
  o "snow" mode with a nice Winter scene picture background and snowflakes
      falling
  o "squig" mode from squig/xsquig (xsquig is too slow)
  o A NT-like GL 3d Maze, where you are inside the maze
  o A NT-like GL wobbling Text (OS by default like flag)
  o NT-like GL FlowerBox spring and Flying Objects
  o A GL 4d ico where the 6 4D "platonic" objects "roll" around in 3d space.
  o GL modes based on demos: isosurf, reflect, bounce, stex3d
  o KitCat (R) clock mode (based on X11 catclock, a version of xclock) where
     the cat clock floats around the screen like "dclock" mode does.  Colors
     of cat clock could be picked like nose-guy in "nose" mode.

PLEASE NOTE:
-----------
  I _REALLY_ hate to turn down contributions...  I will try to consider
   all submissions.  Some things on new modes that bother me are:
   Did not black out the screen when they start.  I do not like people
     to see what I am doing. :^|
   Did not work in the little window or buggy.
   Is too similar mode to a mode that already exists.
   Many people complained about the mode.
   Just not enough randomness or is not interesting enough.
   No multiscreen support.
   But I labor over them (in a haphazard fashion) and they usually are
    released eventually (in fact the queue is now empty! :( ).
