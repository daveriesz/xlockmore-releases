Purify Problems (problems are now marked in code with "PURIFY")

leak:                       galaxy.c (no idea, could be a big one)
                            life3d.c (may be just a fancy algorthm, faked out?)
                            resource.c (faked out?)
                            mode.c[XStringListToTextProperty]

uninitialized memory read (Solaris, OK now?):
                            passwd.c[(void) strcpy(user, pw->pw_name);]
                            passwd.c[pw = getpwnam(user);]
                            passwd.c[if (pw && (pw->pw_uid != uid))]
                            passwd.c[pw = getpwnam(ROOT);]
                            logout.c[pwp = getpwuid(uid);]

duplication of file descriptor (multiple opens but no close)
(Solaris, OK now?):         nose.c[utils.c[if ((pp = popen(progrun, "r"))) {]]

SOLVED since xlockmore-3.12

unitialized memory read:    image.c world.c ball.c cartoon.c pacman.c worm.c

duplication of file descriptor (multiple opens but no close):

                            rplay[unnamed socket...]
