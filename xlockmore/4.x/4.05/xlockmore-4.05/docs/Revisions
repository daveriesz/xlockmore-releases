  Jamie Zawinski (xscreeensaver compatibility), and myself.
  Other contributors are always welcome. :)
Please send all bug reports to bagleyd@bigfoot.com .

Make sure you use the new XLock.ad resource file (or at least remove the old
one) otherwise several modes will not be set up nicely.  This is usually put
as a file in $HOME/XLock and/or
$WHEREVER_X11_IS_LOADED/lib/X11/app-defaults/XLock .

BUGS to fix and other stuff to do
  See "Some open problems" in the README.

4.05
  Fixes for bat and ifs leaks.  Thanks to Tom Schmidt <tschmidt@micron.com>
    for his purify report.
  Fix for galaxy (floating point error on FreeBSD) with help from Bruce
    Evans <bde@zeta.org.au>.
  Changed configure so that -lgl is only for IRIX.
  sierpinski in 3D thanks to Antti Kuntsi <kuntsi@iki.fi>.  -size 3 it will
    have 3 corners and -size 4 it will have 4 corners... all others cause it
    to pick 3 and 4 randomly.
  Thanks to Tim Mooney <mooney@dogbert.cc.ndsu.NoDak.edu> for his patch to
    configure for Digital Unix and using prefix to set the app-defaults
    directory. 
  Thanks to Jouk Jansen <joukj@crys.chem.uva.nl> for his new crystal.c.
    Now all orthogonal unit cell crystals are represented (quasicrystals
    are not).  Fix for bad memory access and refresh.
  Thanks to Charles Vidal <cvidal@newlog.com> for his improved xlock.tcl.
  Modified Makefiles.in used by configure.  A make can be made in xlock and
    modes/gl directories.  Should be OK now with BSD make but I have not
    tested it.  Also added setuid and password stuff. 
  XPM MesaGL conflict lock pick solved by having the iconified window to have
    fixed colors.  This was added to fixedColors in utils.c .  Other writable
    colormap modes were updated to handle this.  This also solves the problem
    of the "black" password screen not being black.  This probably does not
    fix the real cause of the problem...
  Better color handling of OpenGL.  Still not perfect.  GL modes may look
    bad in PseudoColor and tube and swirl (and bat, image, puzzle, and
    cartoon with XPM) may look bad in TrueColor at least on a 8 bit display.
  Many thanks to Jongki Suwandi <Jongki.Suwandi@eng.Sun.COM> who figured out
    what -dtsaver does and how to use it.  See README.
  Fix so that when DT changes the modes on xlock it does not cause errors in
    the errorlog.
  Pipes in the pipe mode going towards "near" and "far" should no longer be
    invisible in OpenGL.
  Put more shapes in tube.
 
4.04
  Thanks to Marcelo F. Vianna <vianna@cat.cbpf.br> for speed ups in morph3d
    Created the great new rubik gl mode.  D. Bagley made it a lot more
    unreadable but also made it NxNxN.
  fract name changed to vines. If batchcount is zero then each iteration
    will produce a complete vine, otherwise it will produce a portion of
    the vine.  Nice values for growing the vines to be -batchcount 100
     and -delay 50000.  Thanks to David Hansen <dhansen@metapath.com>
  Thanks to Tom Schmidt <tschmidt@micron.com> for his password window
    patches for server name and mode descriptions.
  Thanks to Christian von Roques <roques@pond.sub.org> for his galaxy speed
    ups.
  Thanks to John Gotts <jgotts@engin.umich.edu> for his syslog display patch.
  Changed flag to allow it to change between image and message.
  New directory structure.  configure still needs some more work to get
    it to make from any internal directory.  configure should now get the
    correct xapp directory.  Many "ideas" were taken from Jamie Zawinski's
    xscreensaver.  Thanks to Jouk Jansen <joukj@crys.chem.uva.nl> for his
    new make.com.
  puzzle should no longer bomb out with BadMatch if in a window.
    Thanks to David Hansen <dhansen@metapath.com> for handling the -inroot
    case.
  Thanks to Charles Vidal <cvidal@newlog.com> for starting 2 more gui
    interfaces xalock, this time using Athena and libsx, and etc/xlock.java.
  -parent <window id> patch to be used with -inwindow option.  This option
    will be used on the GNOME project (http://www.gnome.org).  Thanks to
    Radek Doulik <doulik@karlin.mff.cuni.cz>.
  Added 12 and 6 bit for defaultVisualInfo.
  Moved config directory to etc... imake could get confused.
  Fixed color.c so that it could handle the case when all colors are used up.
  sphere.c now can have the shadow in 4 different locations... it is randomly
    chosen when init_sphere is run.  Fixed a bug if sphere was restarted. 
  Fixed sierpinski and wire if there are only a few colors.
  Fixed escher.c it had FALSE instead of "False" in 2 places and was
    causing problems on 64 bit Digital Unix.
  Fall throughs in case statements found on hop and ant.
  hop would sometimes give a blank screen for a nonexisting hop.
  hop now centered and scaled better.
  ifs and strange are now reinitialized when refreshed... the size
    of the window could have changed.
  Ideas in DT workaround in README from Wade Wegner
    <wwegner@surveyor.aae.uiuc.edu>
  munch lifted from xscreensaver.
  Thanks to Eric McDonald <e@aw.sgi.com> for his help on the SGI 12 bit
    display.
  Imakefile patch for SCO and Sun with OGL.
  Configure patch for Purify.
  Dave Prosser <dfp@sco.com> SVR4 random image patch.
  allautomata, allspace, allgeometry add.  allstandard taken away.
    This also puts stuff back in alphabetical order except the special
    modes.
  Password window username now displays host and display info.  Display info
    only displayed if significant.
  puzzle patched to handle bomb when batchcount was negative.
  inline patch if set -ansi -pedantic .
  More xscreensaver compatibility.  flag and others need a bit more work.
  Added eyes and swarm mouse options, very similar to the julia code.
  Patch for Solaris2.6 .
  Fix, sometimes flags would have enough room to fly.

4.03
  Thanks to Jouk Jansen <joukj@crys.chem.uva.nl> for VMS GL patches and
    new mode, crystal.
  Thanks to Ed Mackey <emackey@early.com> for taking out some common code
    to all GL modes and placed it in utils.c.  Also found BIG leak in
    gears.c, rewrote sproingies (now handles more sproingies and have
    better explosions and not have 2 sproingies generated from the same
    spot at the same time).  Added many neat things to pipes.
  Thanks to Tom Schmidt <tschmidt@micron.com> for his memory leak fixes
    to xmlock.c and option.c.  More unresolved leaks and uninitialized memory
    reads are noted in the source.  Handle matherr in utils.c.
    Fixed uninitialized memory reads in pyro and worm for -use3d.
  Thanks to Marcelo F. Vianna <vianna@cat.cbpf.br> for speed ups in all gl
    modes.  Removed conflict between pipes and superquadrics & sproingies.
    Pipes to handle -inwindow better.  Created the great new escher gl mode.
  Thanks to Jamie Zawinski <jwz@netscape.com> for
    VMS hlp capability make -f Makefile.in hlp
    braid spin can go the other way, flag font and image capability,
    ifs and strange less flashy, julia mouse option, sphere draws all 4 ways
    swirl debugged on 24 bit sgi... it needs 32 bits
  Thanks to Curtis Larsen <larsen@rtp3.med.utah.edu> for a new improved
    bounce mode when run in -inroot.
  Thanks to Jeff Epler <jepler@inetnebr.com> for less tight turns in pipes.
  Thanks to Scott Carter <scarter@sdsc.edu> for check that only regular files
    are read in the .xlockmessage, .plan, .signature.  (Tom Schmidt did this
    for all fopen calls except one :) ).
    Tabs here are now interpreted.
  Jason Larke <jlarke@psc.lsa.umich.edu> for his AFS patch so nonsence lines
    in passwd or shadow do not cause the xlock to barf.
  release code now called in finish originally written by Ron Hitchens
    <ron@idiom.com>.
  XSetScreensaver now only called if locking the screen.  Also able to turn
    it off now in blank mode.
  starting to remove the dependencies on MAXSCREENS and NUMCOLORS
  bigcrypt added for HP secure passwords.
  `xlock -mode spline -cycles 1 -erase` fixed.
  boubloule bug solve using -use3d.  all3d modelist option added.
  New mode added, voters.
  life3d.c leak fix.
  Lifeforms added P3 Question, P8 Asym, and P8 Smiley added from 
    http://www.halcyon.com/hkoenig/LifeInfo/LifeInfo.html
    life.c can now handle -neighbors 3, 4, 6, 8, 9 and 12.  New pointer
    algorithm.  Hexagons for life, demon, & ant now look better.
    wator.c can now handle -neighbors 3, 4, 6, 8, 9 and 12.
  hop fix for multiscreens.  Most of xmartin2.2 algorithms stolen.  xmartin
    was written by Ed Kubaitis <ejk@ux2.cso.uiuc.edu>.
  a swirl fix for multisceens... one screen if larger than the other would
     not reach its maximum size.
  xmlock string options are now all in quotes.
  bitmaps, pixmap and flag links are now no longer destroyed with a make
    clean.
  stderr is used for the VERBOSE stuff unless its informational stuff about
    the mode as in ant and life*.
  tube nolonger changes fg and bg.  Should nolonger bomb out on TrueColor.
  Can now use Makefile to adjust SYSLOG stuff.
  Found a bug in ant and galaxy fixed on the HP-UX 9.0.
  Got rid of some flashing of the grelb on eyes.
  Reinitialize qix lines on each init_qix call.  This gets rid of old lines
    reappearing.
	Added -imagefile option for bitmaps in life, life1d, and maze.   eyes and
    pacman will require more thought.  flag now can have a runtime message or
    use bitmaps.  Thanks to Jamie Zawinski.
	Put random colors on the nose guy.
	Added -grabserver option for unsecure SGI.
  Bug in strcat_firstword fixed thanks to <Jeffrey_Doggett@caradon.com>
    Fix for ":not found" text that appears after about 40 minutes.
 
4.02
  Logout patch for SUNOS4, galaxy and life3d leak fix thanks to Tom Schmidt.
    inline and seteuid patches for configure and xlock.h.
  flag-freebsd.h added.
  First mode was not being released in random mode.  Fixed.
  new ellipse code from Dan Stromberg <strombrg@nis.acs.uci.edu> (formerly
    named trig) added to helix  (xlock -mode helix -ellipse).
  -fullrandom option added to make xlock more random.  Thanks to Jouk
    Jansen <joukj@crys.chem.uva.nl>.  So far only drift, helix, hop, &
    spline are set up.  Spline in -erase mode has cycles divided by 64
    so it is compatible with +erase.  New options added to hop (-jong
    and -sine).
  Got SunC++, GnuC++, DECC++ errors and warnings out of xlock.c, passwd.c,
    utils.c, logout.c, cartoon.c, clock.c, galaxy.c, life1d.c, turtle.c,
    worm.c, bomb.c, fract.c, tube.c .  It still does not link.
    GnuC++ was tested on Linux and Solaris.  Thanks to Jouk Jansen
    <joukj@crys.chem.uva.nl> for the DECC++ patches.
  Thanks to Tom Schmidt <tschmidt@micron.com> for his memory leak fixes
    to gears.c, mode.c, & resource.c.  MesaGL 2.1 has some leaks that were
    reported to the MesaGL maintainer and fixed in 2.2.  Also fixed swirl,
    and GL modes so they always default to the best visual.  Also added
    -visual (available with hackers code).  gears and morph3d fixed to be
    more random at start.
	gears and morph3d multiscreen bug fixed by Brian Paul
    <brianp@ra.avid.com> MesaGL creator.
  Thanks to Massimino Pascal <Pascal.Massimon@ens.fr> for ifs and strange.
  Thanks to Marcelo F. Vianna <vianna@cat.cbpf.br> for morph3d and pipes.
  Thanks to Dan Stromberg <strombrg@nis.acs.uci.edu> for tube.
  Thanks to Caleb Cullen <CCullen@hal-pc.org> for lisa.
	On Solaris, initial random mode was not random.  This was fixed by a
    cast for SRAND.  Also updated references for seconds() from long or
    int to unsigned long.  time(NULL) will exceed maximum signed int in
    2038.
  flag jumpiness and gears -mono fixed thanks to Ed Mackey
    <emackey@early.com>  http://www.early.com/~emackey/sproingies/.
    Sproingies and superquadrics GL modes and -wireframe option added.
    "configure --enable-sproingies"    sproingies is not compiled in by
    default since it may run VERY slow on some machines.  Also the -size
    option may help you here (thanks to Tom Schmidt for this option).
  Thanks to Tracy Camp <campt@hurrah.com> for fract with improvements by
    David Hansen <dhansen@metapath.com>.
  "Minor" security hole noticed by David Hedley <hedley@cs.bris.ac.uk>.
    Minor in that the array is in the heap and not the stack, so it would
    be tricky to write an exploit.  Patched up by David Hansen
    <dhansen@metapath.com>.
  Debian bug report fix Bug#8276: xlockmore: xlock -help should output
    to stdout rather stderr, thanks to Heiko Schlittermann
    <heiko@lotte.sax.de> for pointing it out.  xlock -version fixed too.
  Debian bug report fix Bug#8406: app file was not being read when configure
    was used.  Fixed.  Thanks to Herbert Xu <herbert@greathan.apana.org.au>
    and Dirk Eddelbuettel <edd@rosebud.sps.queensu.ca> for pointing it out.
  added allnice, allstandard, allstable to modelist choices for the
    random mode.  Any mode that runs slower than star mode is considered
    not nice.  If gl modes are compiled in, these are considered
    nonstandard modes.  If hackers modes are compiled in, these are
    considered unstable modes.  To get only GL modes try:
      xlock -mode random -modelist allstable-allstandard
    allgl works too if you do not want to type that much. :)
  X11 ico added added dodecahedron, tetrahedron, and the star octahedron.
    -face and other options were removed to ease port.
  -resources now prints out the resources for mode options.
  button-logout and auto-logout rearranged.  Also the logout button should
    no longer overwrite your plan.  See "configure --help".  Note: 0 is a
    special case and handled as infinity.
  -icongeometry 1x1 fixes for bug, hop, and triangle .
  fvwm2 menus thanks to James G. Feeney <james@albion.glarp.com>
  Changed pause on multiscreens so that if pausing the second screen will
    not override it.  Its not exactly right but I am happy with it for now.
  Thanks to Charles K. Hines <chuck_hines@vnet.ibm.com> for fixing grav.c
    bug, casts to unsigned int.
  LDFLAGS used if using cc on Solaris.  There could be library problems if
    setuid to root.
	-neighbors 8 & 3 added to ant and  8, 3, 9, & 12 added for demon.
  Fix on FreeBSD with xlock setuid and xdm for $HOME/.Xauthority thanks to
    Thomas Gellekum <thomas@ghpc6.ihf.rwth-aachen.de>.
  -sequential option for random.  Since the random mode is the most easily
    broken... its good to have repeatability.

4.01
  Fix in xlock.c if the HOME variable is not set.  Fix in demon.c for
    multiscreens thanks to David Hansen <dhansen@metapath.com>.
  Security hole when xlock is setuid to root found by Richard Jones
    <richard@a42.deep-thought.org> (this affects all previous releases).
		Similar problem found by David Hansen <dhansen@metapath.com>.
    Thanks to David Hansen for his solution of mallocing userfile,
    appdefaults, modname, modeclassname, fullname, fullclassname, buf
    variables.  Also the memory leak on line 831 of GetResources variable
    classname is believed solved (David Hansen again).  In utils.c get_dir
    "dir" and "filename" are forced to remain within the sizes of DIRBUF
    and MAXNAMLEN respectively.
  Thanks to Tom Schmidt <tschmidt@micron.com> for adding --enable-hackers
    --with-includes and --with-libraries and patching up the handling of
    Editres in configure.in .  A gears and tube bug patched.  Also
    contributed new Purify report showing many problems with the GL modes
    (gears and morph3d).
  Thanks to Jouk Jansen <joukj@crys.chem.uva.nl> for the DECC patches.

4.00
  xlock.html thanks to vh-man2html .
	Patch for SGI to kill the Xsgi process when using 4Dwm thanks to
    Martin Ebert <hi17@iss.mach.uni-karlsruhe.de> and Phillip Moore
    <phil@ERC.MsState.Edu>.
  Fix for colormap stuff, swirl in random mode could crash xlock, error
    made in ALPHA version.
  Thanks to Alexander Jolk <jolk@ap-pc513b.physik.uni-karlsruhe.de> for a
		update to lissie to handle -size .
  Thanks to Sergio Gelato <gelato@spacenet.tn.cornell.edu> for a bug fix
    for galaxy.
  Fixed a "Bad Match" generated with random mode for multi-headed color
    monitors using -install.
  Thanks to Rick Ohnemus <rick@ecompcon.com> for patches to NAS sound
    stuff. Typos were my fault.
  I noticed a problem with Solaris2 and dirent.h .
    xlock -mode image -imagefile ./bitmaps/
    is supposed to pick a random file.  This mechanism does not seem to
    work too well and may corrupt the filename when you give it a specific
    file name.  Therefore for Solaris2, I compile without dirent.h.
    Check out utils.c and grep on Solaris2 to see more...
    One must give a specific filename on Solaris...  here
    config/xlockrandimage.pl may help you.
  Thanks to Charles Vidal <cvidal@newlog.com> for starting another gui
    interface to xlock, xlock.tcl, in config directory.  Moved xmlock, the
    Motif gui for xlock (also written by Charles Vidal), from hackers
    directory.
  Robert Duff <duffrd@aud.alcatel.com> patch to randomize the starting
    color of marquee.  Same patch applied to blot, bouboule, braid, dclock,
    geometry, flag, helix, hop, kaleid, julia, qix, roll, rotor, spiral,
    spline, swarm, worm.  On bomb, life, triangle this was not done on
    purpose and on others...  flame and lissie it was done already.
  Leaks fixed in gears.c and bomb.c.  Purify was not used so there could be
    others there.
  dclock should work correctly in password window... i.e. it should not get
    stuck, and randomized initial direction.
  penrose.c  run with -verbose and it will tell you when it hits some
    weirdness (about once an hour) "Dislocation occurred!"
    If it says "Weirdness...." it would have terminated previously.
  Updated make.com to use links instead of copies.  Thanks to Jouk Jansen
    <joukj@crys.chem.uva.nl>.
  Thanks to Tom Schmidt <tschmidt@micron.com> for fixing the formatting
    on the "hours elapsed since locked." message and logout patches.
    Also for adding several options to configure.
  Thanks to Tim Mooney <mooney@dogbert.cc.ndsu.NoDak.edu> for Digital Unix
    (aka OSF1) for patches to the Imakefile.
  Middle button fix and monochrome random mode fix for multiscreens.
    Multiscreen patch for marquee and nose.
  Updated xlock.h not to have a \ at the end a line with a #if.  VAXC chokes.
  Updated size and batchcount in ball and size in pyro.
  Updated mode.c for maze.  Incorrect if XLock.ad was not installed.
  Updated turtle.c.  Incorrect HARTER_HEIGHTWAY mode and float casts to int
    to please the VMS god.
  Updated ant.c to handle more kinds of ants.  Thanks to J Austin David
    <Austin.David@tlogic.com>.  Check out http://havoc.gtf.gatech.edu/austin
  Hackers modes moved to main directory.  cartoon.c may be kind of flashy
    with -install and without it you might not get any cartoons.  Looks OK
    on monochrome.
  audio stuff for VMS is in config directory.
  Updated grav compiletime options now runtime options-> -decay and -trail.
  New "-version" option now pulls the version from version.h.  Also added a
    more verbose option "-verbose" for maximum verbosity.  -v now gets
    version instead.
  New "-sound" option added.  It is off by default.  If on it will only work
    if RPLAY, NAS, VMS_PLAY, or DEF_PLAY are used at compile-time.
  "Feature" where truncated mode names were accepted, such as "-mode s" now
    give an error.  It did not work well anyway (above example ran shapes in
    monochrome).
  Thanks to Alexander Lehmann <lehmann@mathematik.th-darmstadt.de> for adding
    backspace capability Control-H for marquee (but not with -message).
  configure is now used.  At this stage the Imakefile is still probably
    more reliable.  The Makefile.[acc hp std sun] are no longer supported.
    (But are in config for reference).  The Imakefile and make.com are still
    supported.  imake has fallen out of favor with me.  imake is sometimes
    not configured well, its make depend is confusing (some systems it is not
    required), and cumbersome (and ugly) "@@\"'s are used to do more
    complicated things.  And it is not installed on some HP's.
    A few things have been added for configure, but NOT used with Imakefile
    or make.com:
      config.h.in -> config.h  when "configure" is run.
        This file is where the users options are stored.  These may depend
        more on the administrator/user than on the system, but some options
        are not available on some machines.  See "configure --help".
        If this file is modified... a "make clean" should be done unless you
        know what your doing.
      Makefile.in -> Makefile  when "configure" is run.
      configure.in -> configure  when "autoconf" is run.  Note: autoconf is
        a GNU product that may not be installed.  This is need only if you
        update configure.in .
     Although there is some VMS support features in Makefile.in... full
       support for MMS, MMK, or VMS-GNU-MAKE is not there yet.

3.13
  loop.c added, it is not exactly a screen saver, but it demonstrates
    self-production.
  turtle.c added.  Recursive turtle graphics.  The only one that works
    at present is the Hilbert curve (which is may not exactly be
    a turtle curve... but close enough).
  Thanks to M G Berberich <berberic@forwiss.uni-passau.de> for .plan and
    .signature stuff and purify log.
  bomb and signature updates for VMS thanks to Jouk Jansen
    <joukj@crys.chem.uva.nl>.
  flag fix for negative size thanks to <Mark_Buglewicz@itd.sterling.com>.
  MULTIPLE_ROOT & passwd in compat mode bug fix and NAS sound patch bug
    fix thanks to Dave Smith <drs@aeolians.bt.co.uk>.
  Thanks to Tom L. Schmidt <tschmidt@micron.com> for purify logs.
  Many leaks patched thanks to Purify!  grep on "PURIFY" to find
    unresolved leaks.  Purify file is in the docs directory.
  2 problems in the Imakefile cleaned up thanks to Simon Josefsson
    <jas@pdc.kth.se>.
  Patch to allow marquee to handle extended character set >=128
    Alexander Lehmann <lehmann@mathematik.th-darmstadt.de>.
  XPM files now work with -install (thanks to XPM maintainer Arnaud
    Le Hors for pointing me in the right direction).  Managed to reserve
    black and white, but not fg and bg does not work.  Sometimes in random
    mode the colors are not mapped correctly.
  -geometry should now work again without excessive refreshing.
  Refresh update on image.c.
  ball, julia, roll in the hackers directory are probably ready for
    prime-time but have not been BETA tested.

3.12
  swirl will cause xlock to dump core or CRASH OS within 50 repetitions
    when run in random mode, fixed.
  xlock -mode tri -mono  dies, fixed.
  xlock -mode swirl +install  with netscape (stealing colors) running
    is even less reliable, fixed.
  daisy and slip are sometimes in red when there are no colors left, fixed.
  After the delay has expired the first button click only redraws the
    current mode.  It then takes a second click to activate the
    password display.  Fixed thanks to David Hansen <dhansen@metapath.com>.
  Individual -size option added (like batchcount).  -gridsize removed.
    If 0 it will use the bitmap if available.  If negative it will be
    random from 1 to -size inclusive (like batchcount).
  Combined star mode with rock mode.  rock mode removed.
    -trek, -rock, -straight options.  Star Trek features by Heath Rice
    <rice@asl.dl.nec.com>.
  dclock updated offscreen so there is no annoying flashing.  Originally
    submitted by Michael Stembera <mrbig@fc.net>.
  bomb mode back... but its essentials are NOT compiled in by default.
  Patches for SUNOS_ADJUNCT_PASSWD thanks to Mark Buglewicz
    <mark@itd.sterling.com>.
  Many modes patched that did not initialize the redrawing variable.
  Demon bug solved when alternating between iconified window and normal
    window.
  mountain patched so it would not be so slow.
  life1d much improved.  It now has a fade out if it is found repeating.  
    Now can break without it completing a whole screen.  -totalistic
    option added (+totalistic -> LCAU collection instead).
  Updated clock to use batchcount  (i.e. many clocks) .. if there are too
    many collisions it will draw less clocks.
  Thanks to Rene' Driessen <rdr@crys.chem.uva.nl>
    xlock -mode puzzle -mono ( -inwindow | -debug )
    will get a Bad Match if obscured (but still errors out if moved off
    screen).
  Updated modes to use size instead of batchcount... clock, flag,
    maze, penrose.
  Updated modes to use size instead of cycles... bouboule, star.
  Updated modes to use size instead of worm's CIRCSIZE, and galaxy's STARSIZE.
  Updated other modes to use size bat, bounce, ant, demon, life1d, life,
    wator, wire.
  galaxy bug on VAX now gone... not sure why...  Disappeared when I added
    temporary sin and cos calculations for efficiency.
  Thanks to Dr. George D M Ross <gdmr@dcs.ed.ac.uk> for SYSLOG (xlock.c)
    and NETGROUP patches (logout.c).
  Thanks to Gabor Herr <herr@iti.informatik.th-darmstadt.de> for pointing
    out that uid and gid privileges should be taken away unconditionally
    after the encrypted password is grabbed.  Otherwise, it may lead to a
    major security hole depending on how it is installed.
  xmlock.c added to hackers directory.  Thanks to Charles Vidal
    <cvidal@newlog.com> for starting a gui interface to xlock.  Feel free
    to improve upon it, but mail me your diffs.
  -DUSE_HACKERS compiletime option added (cartoon.c took a step back,
    nobody's fault but mine).
  ant mode with -truchet memory leak found.  Refreshing improved.

3.11
  Ron Hitchens <ron@idiom.com> Updated xlock so it would refresh more
    reliably and handle window resizing and -inroot
  -neighbors is now randomly 4 or 6 if not 4 or 6.  This affects the ant and
    demon mode.  Thanks to Jouk Jansen <joukj@crys.chem.uva.nl>.
  -help now displays help messages of each mode if there is one.
  Changed _opts to include a separate counter for opts and vars & desc
    since they do not have to be the same if there are boolean switches.
  Added a -truchet option to ant, this leaves a trail of the ant.
    One should probably change -gridsize to see it more clearly.
  Added a -erase option to spline, if used one should make -cycles low,
    say 20.
  My long request for a penrose algorithm has been answered :) ,
    penrose.c added thanks to Timo Korvola <tkorvola@dopey.hut.fi> .
    -ammann will show ammann lines.  These were useful for debugging
    penrose.c .  It is currently my favorite mode.  Once I saw it do
    a dislocation, I think.
  tri.c added thanks to Desmond Daignault <tekdd@dtol.datatimes.com> .
    I would like to see other fractals added to this like fern.
  daisy.c added.  I modeled it after some slow PC lockscreen in the office.
  More 3d options besides rock: bouboule, pyro, & worms.  Rock patched up.
    Now includes overlap color if colormap is installed.  Thanks to
    Henrik Theiling <theiling@coli.uni-sb.de> .
    There is a bug on some machines with rock mode.  A border of red can
    be seen around the magenta rock (which should be blue).  This happens
    on my Sun with the colormap installed but not on Linux.
  Password code mallocs fixed up and BSD_AUTH code added thanks to
    Paul Borman <prb@bsdi.com> .
  2 problems in Kerberos code and 2 in the Imakefile cleaned up thanks
    to Simon Josefsson <jas@pdc.kth.se> .
  Kerberos 5 added thanks to Dale Harris <rodmur@ecst.csuchico.edu> .
  Multi user per uid patch thanks to der Mouse
    <mouse@collatz.mcrcim.mcgill.edu> .
  Now should compile under C++, but it complains about signaling, pclose,
    crypt, and gethostname when linking.
  All modes now have refresh hooks, but some just call the init_ hook.
    lissie, bug, rotor, spline -erase and worm hooks thanks to Alexander
    Jolk <jolk@ap-pc513b.physik.uni-karlsruhe.de> .
    On slip, penrose, and puzzle, I made no attempt.
  All modes now have change hooks.  All except random call the init_ hook.
    So when running a mode you can get it to restart by pressing the middle
    button on your mouse.  This does not work with the password window up
    but probably should.
  Added -debug runtime switch.  Formerly accessed only by -DDEBUG.  Some
    debug switches are still only accessed in this way.
  -rule for life and -rule3d for life3d runtime switches.  Also a real
    change hooks for these modes.  For -rule3d if set to 0 all rules that
    have known patterns will randomly selected.  If set to 1 all rules that
    have known gliders will be randomly selected.
  "xlock -inwindow -lockdelay 10" now should work.
  Sped up sphere by not drawing off screen.
  Added a hackers directory for hackers.
  Added hooks to Imakefile for MesaGL.  No mode uses this yet see the
    hackers directory.

3.10
  Reorganized bitmaps.  All single bitmaps use "image_" inside the bitmap
    file.  They are now organized t-tiny, s-small, m-medium, and l-large.
    That way one can, if one wished, one can use one bitmap file for eyes,
    image, life, life1d, maze, and puzzle at compile-time.
  Removed all references to Scr, screen, and dsp in the modes.
  Release mode stuff added to all modes (except random).  Rewrote image
    initialization for bat, image, and puzzle to make it safe for
    multiscreens (image and puzzle are still not correct for multiscreens).
  Negative batchcounts now allowed, if negative it will be random from
    the smallest allowed positive batchcount to ABS(batchcount), inclusive.
    It is available on
      ant, bat, bounce, bug, eyes, flag, galaxy, geometry, grav, image, laser,
      lissie, maze, mountain, petal, puzzle, rock, spiral, spline, swarm,
      world, worm.
  More mallocing (and freeing) done for bat, bounce, bug, eyes, galaxy,
    geometry, image, lissie, maze, puzzle, rock, rotor, spline, wator, world,
    worm, so there are less predefined limits.  In the case of eyes and rock,
    some limits were imposed where a dynamic number of pixmaps were
    dynamically declared, so that xlock would not easily slow down to a crawl
    and run out of memory.
  bug now uses gridsize.  And to some degree life, life1d, and wator.
    It would be neat if you could choose not to use the bitmaps for big
    windows.
  worm now uses cycles for length of worm and galaxy uses cycles now too.
    rock uses cycles for max rock size.
  One no longer has to hit return twice to unlock using lockdelay.
  flag now uses batchcount for "point" size.
  XClearWindow is used instead of filling screen with a big black rectangle.
  Added -icongeometry option. It has a range of 1x1 to 256x256 .  Position
    information is ignored.  Updated modes to handle weird geometry's bat,
    bounce, braid, bug, eyes, kaleid, life, life1d, maze, nose, puzzle,
    wator, world.
  mountain changed to allow it to be interrupted quicker, (braid and slip
    are harder :) ).
  bounce changed to get rid of drawing errors.  I could not figure out how
    easily remove more without the balls flashing.
  wire mode added based on code from Kevin Dahlhausen <ap096@po.cwru.edu>
    and Stefan Strack <stst@vuse.vanderbilt.edu>.
  lightning mode added thanks to Keith Romberg <kromberg@saxe.com>.
  in xlock.c, in function runMainLoop, reads should be declared not as
    struct fd_set.  This causes compilation errors with Linux kernels 2.0
    and higher.  Thanks to Brian R. Doherty <doherty@rice.edu>.
  "nice" patch for xlock to so that xlock is "not so nice" when a password
    window is being presented.  Thanks to Jouk Jansen
    <joukj@crys.chem.uva.nl>.
  lightning, eyes, maze, shape patched for multiscreens.  XPM stuff patched
    for multiscreens (thanks to XPM maintainer Arnaud Le Hors).
    Tested on a machine where 0.0 is black/white, 0.1 is 8 bit color.
    Also random mode does not use the correct initial values of modes on
    multiscreens.  Testing on multiscreen thanks to Mark Wedel
    <mwedel@pyramid.com>.
  Long standing bug fixed (>= before MAXBATCH) for flame.c thanks to Ron
    Charlton <crc@ornl.gov>.
  puzzle when in -inwindow or compiled with -DDEBUG and moved off screen
    will not bomb out unless it is using an xbm image.  This should be
    completely fixed in 3.11.
  New defaults: grelb substituted for life icon, -install for 
    installation of the colormap, some modes slowed down so they would look
    correct on fast machines.
 
3.9
  All modes (except eyes.c) have been updated to use less global variables.
    Also updated xlockmore to ANSI C by GNU's protoize.
  demon.c updated to be faster.  Although it is now significantly more
    complicated.
  ant.c and demon now have runtime options.   -neighbors 6 or 4 (default = 4)
    -gridsize (170 default)  (In ant, when neighbors = 6 it is called bees.
    Not much is known about these critters.  They do not seem to exibit the
    highway building activity found in normal ants, but otherwise they
    behave pretty similar.)
  flag mode thanks to Charles Vidal <cvidal@newlog.com>.
  The Lissajous worm (lissie mode) thanks to Alexander Jolk
    <ub9x@rz.uni-karlsruhe.de>.
  Shape mode now has triangles.  Also now looks better when minimized.
    From an idea in REC (Recreational & Educational Computing).
  Random mode now tells you which mode is running when run with -verbose
    [formerly -v].
    Added VERBOSE stuff to life, life3d, life1d, and ant.
  Changed rock.c to use blue by default for the left eye.  All 3D glasses
    I have seen use blue.
  Fixed swirl so it would not swirl "white".  Even if it is not a bg or fg
    color.  This made the border around the little window change color.
  From Ron Hitchens <ron@idiom.com>:
    patch for middle button so that it will change locks even if duration
      is 0 in random mode.
    patch for window title noticeable when used with the -inwindow option.
    fixed up demon.c
  Random access to raster files by giving a directory thanks to Jouk
    Jansen <joukj@alpha.chem.uva.nl>.  If UNIX, give directory followed by
    a "/", also it may try to put "." as an image file.
  When xlock is compiled with shadow passwords it will still work on non
    shadowed systems that use elf, thanks to Marek Michalkiewicz
    <marekm@i17linuxb.ists.pwr.wroc.pl>  Compilation with HAS_SHADOW is
    forced on Linux with ELF (even if shadow passwording is not used).
    This will facilitate a migration towards shadow passwording.
  For the sake of completeness, xbm files can now be read in at run-time.
    Courtesy of John Bradley's xv(xvbm.c), used by permission.
  "xlock -nolock -lockdelay 1" should no longer crash

3.8
  system call for sounds using DEF_PLAY thanks to Milco Numan
    <milcon@krim.chem.uva.nl>
  Used GNU's indent to reformat all *.c and *.h files.  It may have
    screwed up some comments. I used:
    -bap -nbacc -bad -nbc -br -bs -c33 -cd33 -ncdb -ce
    -d0 -di12 -neei -fc1 -i8 -ip8 -l79 -lp -npcs -psl -nsc -nsob
    -cli8 -cs -cp1
  Multiple root accounts for allowroot.  Thanks to Lewis Muhlenkamp
    <lewism@tt.comm.mot.com>.
  Better make.com file for for VMS thanks to Jouk Jansen and the
    author of XVMSUTILS, Trevor Taylor <taylort@decus.com.au>.
  -display fix for VAX thanks to Jouk Jansen.
  eyes mode, revamp to eliminate need for global variables in modes,
    new hooks (release and refresh), and middle button for "Next" in
    random mode, thanks to Ron Hitchens <ron@idiom.com>.
    This now allows for many things to be cleaned up.  Due to the number
    of modes, it will take a few releases.  See HACKERS.GUIDE.
  puzzle mode thanks to Heath Rice <hrice@netcom.com> & Jouk Jansen
    <joukj@alpha.chem.uva.nl>.
  Raster files (for puzzle.c and image.c) thanks to Tobias Gloth
    <gloth@math.uni-muenster.de> & Jouk Jansen <joukj@alpha.chem.uva.nl>.
    Background is now black when used with -install.
  swirl for 16 bytes per pixel patch <davidm@azstarnet.com>
  bouboule mode memory leaks fixed thanks to Jeremie Petit <jpetit@essi.fr>.
  maze's dead ends are now filled in.
  More syslog stuff for notifying failures in unlocking xlock Andrew Sammut
    <sammut@dstc.qut.edu.au>.
  blank now uses the power-down sleep mode if available, thanks to Ron
    Hitchens <ron@idiom.com>.

3.7
  HP bug timing bug fixed thanks to Ron Hitchens <ron@idiom.com>.
  3D mode for rock thanks to <theiling@coli.uni-sb.de>.
    Get out your 3D glasses, Red on right and Green on left.
  added compile time option for spline, FOLLOW to erase old splines
    like Qix thanks to Richard Duran <rduran@cs.utep.edu>
  petal now works with -inroot .
  CDE DT saver thanks to Trevor Bourget <trevor@thomsoft.com>
    see Imakefile and README.
  bouboule mode added, thanks to Jeremie Petit <jpetit@essi.fr>.
    bouboule fixed for VMS and TrueColor.

3.6
  Many patches, thanks to Ron Hitchens <ron@idiom.com>.
    xlock now appears over the screensaver, passwd.c reorganized,
    new event loop in xlock.c, new icons in bitmaps, updated clock
    and triangle, and resource parsing fixed for "xlock".
  pedal renamed to petal.
  Clock mode updated to change in size thanks to original author
    Petit Jeremie <jpetit@essi.fr>.
  More context handling stuff for DCE thanks to Terje Marthinussen
    <terjem@cc.uit.no>.
  slip mode added thanks to Scott Draves <spot@cs.cmu.edu>
    with a patch from <joukj@alpha.chem.uva.nl>.
  patch for -messagesfile code favored early quotes and new event loop
    compatibility thanks to <joukj@alpha.chem.uva.nl>.
  XLock.ad and xlock.man updated to be more consistent.
  ultrix fix for strdup thanks to Erik Bertelsen <erik@sockdev.uni-c.dk>.
  invalid sound added thanks to <J.M.Box@dcs.warwick.ac.uk>
  Thanks to <mccomb@interport.net> for helping to debug marquee and nose
    on multiheaded machines.
 
3.5
  Fixed my goof on worm.c.
  vms_play fixed for nonexisting sound files and -messagesfile code
    updated thanks to <joukj@alpha.chem.uva.nl>.
  marquee now more random and memmove no longer used.
  marquee fixed for multiheaded machines thanks to Caleb Epstein
    <epstein_caleb@jpmorgan.com>.
  Random number generator fixed for 64 bit "long" thanks to Scott McCoy
    <smccoy@dr3w.ess.harris.com>.

3.4
  rplay patch thanks to Simon Banks <sbanks@cellnet.co.uk>.  xlock now
    has sound where available.  Edit your favorite makefile.
  2 new modes thanks to Tobias Gloth <gloth@math.uni-muenster.de>.
    marquee (I changed a lot) shows text on the screen, similar to nose
    triangle, (colormaping removed) similar to mountain
  nose text functions removed to utils.c
  image.c now with -imagefile option (only with XPM).
  rect.c name changed to shape.c.
  swirl.c and world.c fixed for multiscreens, thanks to Grant McDorman
    <grant@isgtec.com>.
  A better way of handling fortunes from a file, thanks to Jouk Jansen
    <joukj@alpha.chem.uva.nl>.  To try use -messagesfile fortune.dat.
    Also contributed vms_play.c and a new make.com file.
  KERBEROS patch thanks to Omar Siddique <omar@gl.umbc.edu> for sending
    and testing it (patch author unknown).

3.3
  LIFE_5655 and LIFE_6767 compile time options for life3d.
  ultrix passwd bug fix thanks to Erik Bertelsen <erik@sockdev.uni-c.dk>.
  nose now has a font option and is fixed for multiscreens.
  Stupid memory leak in ant fixed.  Now random colors.
  swirl now needs to be used with -install to look right,
    thanks to Heath A. Kehoe <hakehoe@icaen.uiowa.edu>.
  Patch for AIX thanks to Jouk Jansen <joukj@crys.chem.uva.nl>.
  Color pixmaps for bat from <patol@info.isbiel.ch>.
  image pixmaps now default to bitmaps if xpm fails, thanks to
    <Markus.Zellner@anu.edu.au>.
  flame crashed xlock when using random mode on Linux, fixed.
  Numerous fixes for multiscreens incl: bat, bounce, rect, hyper, life1d,
    forest, laser, mountain, and braid.  Also xlock.c patched or second
    screen would have a black and white display.
    Purify found memory leaks in swirl, mountain, laser, hyper, maze.
    Thanks to <mccomb@interport.net>.
  New option -lockdelay #, for those who were bothered by xautolock
    locking the screen when you you did not want it, now just hit
    return (within a specified number of seconds) to get the screen back.
    This option is intended to be used with xautolock.
  worm now has no limit on the number of worms.
  pyro bug fixed for large batchcount (500-2000), thanks to
    Minoura Makoto <minoura@flab.fujitsu.co.jp>.

3.2
  Doug McLaren <dougmc@comco.com> noticed a big security hole in
    nose.c when xlock is setuid to root.  Now, after the password is
    read, it gives up root, thanks to Heath A. Kehoe
    <hakehoe@icaen.uiowa.edu>.
  DCE Authentication patch added.
  Thanks to Jouk Jansen <joukj@crys.chem.uva.nl> for clearing up
    a timing problem using -DOLD_EVENT_LOOP .

3.1
  Multipatch by Heath A. Kehoe <hakehoe@icaen.uiowa.edu> it includes
    speed up in helix, random mode now switches modes, input to mode
    is now customizable (see random.c), and a DCE authentication patch
    (based on work by Phil O'Connell <philo@icaen.uiowa.edu>).  Also
    usleep was dropped in favor of a new timing mechanism.  It is still
    available using -DOLD_EVENT_LOOP (VMS still uses it by default).
  braid.c thanks to John Neil <neil@math.idbsu.edu>.
  helix now looks even better.  I found a bug in the translation from
    xscreensaver.
  nose.c may still need a little work (its a bit slow).  Taken from 2
    sources xnlock and xscreensaver's noseguy.  It no longer leaves
    dust on the screen as well (the bitmaps are shifted up by one pixel).
  pedal.c taken from xscreensaver.
  Patches for OSF1_ENH_SEC but it unfortunately seems to need more work.
  Idea to have the mode.h defaults used thanks to Roland Bock
    <exp120@physik.uni-kiel.d400.de>.
  closedown patch for xdm use from Janet Carson's xclosedown
    with modifications from Anthony Thyssen <anthony@cit.gu.edu.au>.
  image.c updated to use xbm if using a monochrome monitor or using -mono.
  life1d, bug.c, ant.c, and demon.c added from Scientific American's
    Computer Recreations.
  hop.c now has Peter de Jong's hop.  Half the time its boring but
    the other half of the time its great.
  A better patch from Peter Schmitzberger <schmitz@coma.sbg.ac.at> for
    spiral (a bug that I introduced).

3.0
  Patch from Peter Schmitzberger <schmitz@coma.sbg.ac.at> for maze and image.
  Thanks to Shane Watts <shane@phobes.mlckew.edu.au> for helping me with
    Linux shadowing.
  world.c backward spinning jump fixed by Neale Pickett <zephyr@nmt.edu>.
  laser.c bug (that I introduced) solved by Heath A. Kehoe
    <hakehoe@icaen.uiowa.edu>.
  Edited rect so that it does ellipses as well, like After Dark.
    I should of renamed it right?
  Got rid of "+=" in Imakefile because HP, AIX, and Ultrix have
    trouble with it.  Still used by some systems where there seems to
    be no trouble.
  passwd.c extracted from xlock.c and xlock.h .  May have cured some
    bugs (like a BIG network security bug) but most likely broke some
    systems.  Thanks for the many people who gave feedback during
    the BETA test.
  
2.10
  xlockrc password for more user control of xlock.  Author unknown.
    It is a compile-time option, see Imakefile and README.
    Moved usleep.c and hsbramp.c to utils.c and logout.c to opt.c .
    Split out mode.h from resource.c .
  Changes of Skip_Burrell@sterling.com were incorporated into image.c .
    Not sure how to get pixmaps to randomize color and -mono does
    not work for pixmaps.  See Imakefile and README.
  -allowroot now works on Solaris2.x.
  Clock mode added, thanks to Jeremie Petit <petit@simula.unice.fr>.
  laser and mountain modes added, similar to After Dark's version, and
    also forest mode thanks to Pascal Pensa <pensa@aurora.unice.fr>.
  Updated maze and helix after seeing mountain mode.  Do not have to
    wait a second to enter password. :)
  Now provide random number generator.  Thanks to Mike Arras
    <arras@intertv.com>.  I changed RAND to LRAND.
  Due to overwhelming demand, the old flame is back... well OK its
    slightly modified.
  Patch for SUNOS_ADJUNCT_PASSWD, thanks to Dale A. Harris
    <rodmur@ecst.csuchico.edu>.
  Imakefile reorganized for AIX.

2.9
  "make install.man" should now work for imake users (if you would like
   it to work for Makefile.hp ...  mail me the patch).  
  Unbundled SunC warnings removed in bitmap files, maze, grav, life,
    and swirl.
  Swirl patched to work sensibly with TrueColor displays, thanks to
    Steve Early <sde1000@cam.ac.uk>
  Rock mode made much better by Jeremie Petit <petit@simula.unice.fr>.
  Imakefile reorganized by <mjacob@feral.COM> for Solaris2.x .
  Reorganized the README and the screens are now (mostly) alphabetical
    throughout.
  Updated life3d to include compile-time options LIFE_5766 and LIFE_4555.
    5766 is more like life, but 4555 (default) seems to be better.
  I went through the lifep.zip (May 94) collection and pulled out some
    small and interesting life forms.
  I added another control to the screens.  "-cycles num" influences the
    time out (it applies to about a 1/3 of the screens, see man pages).
    For consistency, the meaning of batchcount for qix, life, life3d,
    and rect was changed.  References to "seconds()" in the screens were
    removed.  The length of a "cycle" depends on "delay".
  Multidisplay bug fix for maze, thanks to <epstein_caleb@jpmorgan.com>.
  AIXV3 with AFS, thanks to <chuck_hines@VNET.IBM.COM>.

2.8
  No more bomb.c, if you think xlock needs it, let the maintainer know.
  full_lock rewritten by Dale A. Harris <rodmur@ecst.csuchico.edu> to
    handle non-login groups as well.
  fixed a bug in wator, introduced in 2.7.
  fixed nanosleep bug for delays of 1 second or more.  Nanosleep is now
    used by default on Solaris.  The Imakefile will have to be modified
    if using Solaris 2.0-2.2, since nanosleep is not available.
  I do not know why, but the logout out feature now works on Solaris.
  Various warnings and errors fixed in make.com, resource.c, logout.c,
    and galaxy.c for VMS.  Also fixed random generator for VMS not to
    toggle the least significant bit.  This made worm.c look funny.
  xlock now works on VMS/AXP thanks to <JOUKJ@CRYS.CHEM.UVA.NL>.  One
    will have to uncomment sections in make.com .  Also fixed some
    AIX problems.
  Modes spiral and geometry thanks to Darrick Brown <dbrown@cs.hope.edu>.
    Batchcount in maze and spline were changed to behave similarly.
  A patch from Heath Rice <hrice@netcom.com> for a better way to handle
    batchcount, delay, and saturation.
  I went through xlife3.0 huge collection and added "suitable" lifeforms.

2.7
  sgi patches and logos from Dave Truesdell <truesdel@nas.nasa.gov>.
  flame bug fixed thanks to <spot@cs.cmu.edu> and
    <M.R.Dobie@ecs.soton.ac.uk>.
  MANY patches from Heath A. Kehoe <hakehoe@icaen.uiowa.edu> include:
    The long awaited HP patch.  It appears there was a bug in HP's XFlush
    function.  So XSync was substituted.  HP_PASSWDETC patch.
    maze, swarm, and worm -mono now look better.
    Many changes to the Imakefile, new compile time features ...
    including a logout button for labs (this appears to be better
    implementation than the bomb mode (much of the bomb code has been
    reused)) -install option to allow xlock to install its own colormap
    if it runs out of colors.
  Thanks to <slouken@virtbrew.water.ca.gov> for yet another option:
    grabmouse for compatiblilty with xscreensaver.  So you would set
    your apps-defaults file for xscreensaver like:

*programs:      xlock -nolock +grabmouse -mode random

  Updated life3d to include shooting gliders.
  BSD and Linux icons slightly modified.  Also new ships for life.
  Compile time options HAS_RAND, HAS_RANDOM, and HAS_RAND48, and
    updated the sccsid so `what` will give you something meaningful.

2.6
  Created a HAS_USLEEP and a USE_VROOT switch.
    There were numerous reports of the incompatibility with tvtwm,
    (also problems with windows with StickyAbove set to true and
    swirl), read the README section on that.
  Thanks to Chris Ross <cross@va.pubnix.com>, maintainer of tvtwm, for
    fixing various bugs; make depend for R5 and less, life3d should not
    have malloc.h, and a time-elapsed patch. 
  A few new life forms for life.c.  Anyone know what SMILEY is really
    supposed to look like?  :)
  Revised -inroot does not lock screen, as this is done better with the
    following patch, and as someone pointed out, its not intuitive.
  Thanks to Tim Medley for sending the -geometry patch of Mike Peercy
    <peercy@crhc.uiuc.edu>.  Many of the modes will fail if the windows
    are far from square or are too small.  You can place Xlock off the
    screen, for example,
      xlock -enablesaver -mode blank -geometry +1152+0
    puts the window off the visible screen on a Sun.
  A new version of flame.c from the original author Scott Draves
    <spot@cs.cmu.edu>.
  Something really devilish for BSD (new icons) thanks to J Wunsch
    <j@uriah.sax.de>, but they have been modified.  I also created a
    Linux icon.
  A patch for Ultrix systems (at least DECstations) running enhanced     
    security thanks to Chris Fuhrman <cfuhrman@vt.edu> and friend.
  Multidisplay bug fix for life3d and wator, thanks to
    <epstein_caleb@jpmorgan.com>.
  Life3d on a monochrome monitor looks a little better. -mono was
    working right.

2.5
  A patch for swirl for fixed color maps (more colorful) and the
    image now spirals outwards from the center with a fixed number of

  A patch for blot on dual-headed machines and nanosleep, thanks to

  A long needed patch for X11R5+ for -delay, -batchcount, and
    -saturation to work thanks to Patrick D Sullivan <pds@bss.com>.

   the nonperiodic forms were removed.
   life's gliders now come from the edge of the screen, usually.
  image now centers icons, for example, the hp icon is now centered.
  blot now randomly has xsym, ysym, or both.

  "bat" mode disastrous bug fixed.  Thanks to R.K.Lloyd@csc.liv.ac.uk
    for pointing it out.
  -DMOUSE_MOTION switch added for those who want the Password window to
    come up if you just moved the mouse. (Not recommended).
  "swirl" mode was modified to check background, foreground, and black
    so as not to cycle these colors, special thanks to Mark Dobie
    <mrd@ecs.soton.ac.uk>.

2.1
  Large modifications to README.
  Patch for building under QNX 4.2 w/ Metrolink X server, thanks to
    Brian Campbell <brianc@qnx.com>.

2.0
  "swirl" mode was added, thanks to Mark Dobie <mrd@ecs.soton.ac.uk>.
    WOW, but not-so-neat on monochrome monitors.
  Patch for Solaris 2.3 for local, NIS, and NIS+ passwords, thanks to
    <Christian.Iseli@di.epfl.ch>.
  "image" mode was put back but random will not run it, too boring.
  "bomb" mode was added, thanks to <D.T.Shield@compsci.liverpool.ac.uk>.
  In order to use extra-long passwords with the Linux, changed
    PASSLENGTH from 20 to 64.  Thanks to <slouken@virtbrew.water.ca.gov>.

1.14
  Multidisplay bug fix for rect, thanks to <epstein_caleb@jpmorgan.com>.
  Now works on IRIX on the SGI. Thanks to <reggers@julian.uwo.ca>.
  Now works on NetBSD. Thanks to Greg Earle <earle@isolar.Tujunga.CA.US>.
  Now works on a Alpha 3000/400 OSF/1 V2.0. Thanks to Udo Linauer
    <ul@eacpc4.tuwien.ac.at>.
  "galaxy" mode was added, thanks to Hubert Feyrer
    <hubert.feyrer@rz.uni-regensburg.de>.
  "kaleid" mode was added, taken from the Linux version of xkaleid.
  
1.13
  "timeelapsed" option was added.  Allows you to find out how long a
    machine is locked so you can complain to an administrator.
  Now may work on IRIX on the SGI. Thanks to Thomas Runge
    <runge@egd.igd.fhg.de>
  "bat" mode was added, thanks to Lorenzo Patocchi <patol@info.isbiel.ch>.

1.12
  xlock now works on Linux with shadow passwords.  Special thanks to
    H. J. Dihu <macgyver@mcs.com>

1.11
  Shadow passwords and DES encryption are now detected by the Imakefile.
    Victor Langeveld <vic@mbfys.kun.nl> reorganized the Imakefile for 
    shadow passwords and crypt.  Now should compile "right out of the
    box" (although there are still problems on Solaris 2.3).
  Patch to fix sudden rotation changes in rock from Yoshiaki Kasahara
    <kasahara@csce.kyushu-u.ac.jp>.

1.10
  R.K.Lloyd@csc.liv.ac.uk reorganized the Imakefile yet again.
  Fixed a bug in rect.c thanks to <epstein_caleb@jpmorgan.com>.
  Ditched bzero and bcopy since both are more generally available as
    memset and memcpy.  Also removed some lint warnings.

1.9
  "rect" mode was added from xscreensaver's greynetic.
  "helix" bug fixed.  It is now more interesting.
  bounce.c divide by zero fixed and grav.c improvements.  Thanks to Greg
    Bowering <greg@cs.adelaide.edu.au>.
  grav.c, rock.c, world.c fixed so no black objects.

1.8
  Imakefile did not work with R6.  Also Solaris2.3 may use SVR4
    instead of SYSV.  Thanks to Chris P. Ross <cross@eng.umd.edu>
  "grav" mode was added.  Its a simplistic gravitational simulation,
    with (currently a constant 16) solid spheres (non-rendered) of equal
    size and mass orbiting a fixed central mass.  The sphere's orbit in
    3 dimensions, their position and size being projected with simple
    perspective.  Thanks to Greg Bowering <greg@cs.adelaide.edu.au>.
  "inwindow" option was added.  Allows you to do what xlock already
    did when DEBUG was defined.  It no longer locks your screen, but
    allows you to run xlock as a (somewhat distracting) decoration.
    Thanks to Greg Bowering <greg@cs.adelaide.edu.au>.
  "bounce" mode (football) is back.
  "world" mode was added.  Thanks to Matthew Moyle-Croft
    <mmc@cs.adelaide.edu.au>
  "image" mode was removed. It was very similar to world anyway.

1.7
  cuserid() is needed by Solaris2.3 with shadow passwords in xlock.c.
    Thanks to Bill <benedett@gentire.com>.

1.6
  R.K.Lloyd@csc.liv.ac.uk pointed out again that gray_bits in maze.c needs
    a type cast.
  xlock.c defaults to "blank" to minimize cpu usage on a network.

1.5
  xlock works again on VMS (see README.VMS) thanks to Anthony Clarke
    <Anthony.D.Clarke@Support.Hatfield.Raytheon.bae.eurokom.ie>.
  memcpy and memset definitions for SYSV. Also there now is a switch
    for shadow passwords thanks to <reggers@julian.uwo.ca>.

1.4
  Now works on BSD. Thanks to Victor Langeveld <vic@mbfys.kun.nl>
  Both Victor and Alexandre Miguel <miguel@natacha.ens-cachan.fr>
    suggested taking out the cuserid() call in xlock.c.  For FreeBSD its
    a necessity and the old way is is a security hole in SunOS.

1.3
  Linux port from Darren Senn's (sinster@scintilla.capitola.ca.us) xlock.
  Fixed drand to random in helix.c
  Fixed a memory leak in rock.c.

1.2
  SHIFT - CONTROL - BREAK on the HP is trapped. Thanks to
  R.K.Lloyd@csc.liv.ac.uk who pointed out that this was done in xscreensaver.
  AIXV3 and HP bugs fixed, again due to R. K. Lloyd.

1.1 & 1.0
  took out "rint" from "worm.c" since HP's have trouble with it
  added spline, maze, sphere, hyper, helix, rock, & blot modes.
  fixed "xlock.h" and "usleep" for the HP.
  changed border so it varies with size of screen on "swarm" so the
    wasp would not be stuck in a corner when the password is entered.
