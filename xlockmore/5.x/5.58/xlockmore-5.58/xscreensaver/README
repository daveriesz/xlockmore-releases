# Previously written for xscreensaver-2.17 and xscreensaver-5.10.
This is now for getting xlockmore modes running in xscreensaver-5.43.
Previous version is way out of date, see below.

First figure out how to compile xscreensaver without my changes.
For me I had to do this:
  install intltool 0.51.0
  libglade-2.0 not found... no demo it warns
  no jpeg

  cp -rp xlockmore-5.58 xsreensaver-5.43/xlockmore
  cd xsreensaver-5.43
  edit configure.in replace 
for d in utils jwxyz hacks hacks/glx driver ; do
for d in utils jwxyz hacks xlockmore/xlock xlockmore/modes hacks/glx driver; do
   similar for AC_OUTPUT add these 2 lines after hacks/Makefile
          xlockmore/xlock/Makefile
          xlockmore/modes/Makefile

   autoconf
(I made copies configure.in and configure in this directory, but may go out of date)
  cd xlockmore/xlock
  mv Makefile.inxs Makefile.in
  cd ../modes
  mv Makefile.inxs Makefile.in
  cd ../..
  ./configure
For me I had to edit the config.h and comment out
/*#define HAVE_GDK_PIXBUF 1*/
add next line
#define HAVE_GTK2 1

  make
For me I get en error in blitspin in xscreensaver... so need to build xlockmore.o

Not necessary yet but MI_BITMAP not there...
MI_BITMAP is not present in hacks/xlockmoreI.h and hacks/xlockmore.h
(more work needs to be done)
   add "char *bitmap;" after wireframe_p in ModeInfo in hacks/xlockmoreI.h
   add "#define MI_BITMAP(MI)           ((MI)->bitmap)" after xgwa.screen in hacks/xlockmore.h

 make
 cd hacks
 make xlockmore.o
 cd ../xlockmore/xlock
 make
gives a few warnings
 cd ../modes
 make
New automata.c and automata.h supplied and all automata modes should use this
rather than the one in xscreensaver.
ball and bat converted though it runs it is not working correctly yet
bouboule will not build and will stop there, (can do one extra make braid if you wish)
bouboule will require some changes in xlockmore.h and xlocmoreI.h to do right.
Future

old instructions after this... probably do not apply any more...

------------------------------------------------
xlockmore-modes will install first ...
So during an installation these executables will be overwritten
if there is a conflict with the xscreensavers modes.

See docs/TODO for current problems.

0. OK say you have xscreensaver-5.10/ .  Drop a version of xlockmore in that
   directory and change the name of xlockmore to "xlockmore".
   (This is not 100% tested so it would be wise to read it first!)

      cd xscreensaver-5.10/xlockmore/xscreensaver

1. Makefile.in replaces ../../Makefile.in
   configure.in replaces ../../configure.in
   need autoconf to replace configure... (pick it from your favorite gnu site)

      mv ../../configure.in ../../configure.in.orig
      mv ../../Makefile.in ../../Makefile.in.orig
      cp ./configure.in ../../configure.in
      cp ./Makefile.in ../../Makefile.in
      cd ../..
      autoconf
      cd xlockmore/xscreensaver

2. modes/glx directory goes in xscreensaver/hacks/glx with the old
   Makefile.in (do not write over this file!) and xlock-gl.c

      mv ../../hacks/glx ../../hacks/glx.orig
      cp -R ../modes/glx ../../hacks/glx
      cp ../../hacks/glx.orig/Makefile.in ../../hacks/glx/
#      cp ../../hacks/glx.orig/xlock-gl.c ../../hacks/glx/


3. change Makefiles... make backups

     cp ../xlock/Makefile.in ../xlock/Makefile.inxl
     cp ../modes/Makefile.in ../modes/Makefile.inxl
     cp ../xlock/Makefile.inxs ../xlock/Makefile.in
     cp ../modes/Makefile.inxs ../modes/Makefile.in


4. Then its all ready...

     cd ../..
     ./configure
     make

driver/Makefile

#GL_SRCS         = @SAVER_GL_SRCS@
#GL_OBJS         = @SAVER_GL_OBJS@
