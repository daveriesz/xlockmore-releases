Not sure if its setup the best way for GL.  Still have some WIN32 defines
in every gl mode.

To debug compile with -DEBUG and use "OutputDebugString" to print out
variables.  This can then be printed using Dbgview
http://www.sysinternals.com/   (yeah it got gobbled up my Microsoft).

Recent updates:
bubble, ifs, strange fixed as XCopyPlane(), XSetGraphicsExposures() was added
fixed petri for black default color
