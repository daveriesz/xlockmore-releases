<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2><PRE>
       <B>xlock</B> locks the X server till the user enters  their  password  at  the
       keyboard.   While  <B>xlock</B>  is  running,  all  new server connections are
       refused.  The screen saver is disabled.  The  mouse  cursor  is  turned
       off.   The  screen  is  blanked  and  a  changing pattern is put on the
       screen.  If a key or a  mouse  button  is  pressed  then  the  user  is
       prompted for the password of the user who started <B>xlock</B>.

       If the correct password is typed, then the screen is unlocked and the X
       server is restored.  When typing the password Control‚ÄêU  and  Control‚ÄêH
       are  active  as  kill  and erase respectively.  To return to the locked
       screen, click in the small icon version of the changing pattern.

       In the lower part of the password screen a  text  is  displayed.   This
       message  is  taken  from  the  first file of the following that exists:
       $HOME/.xlocktext, $HOME/.plan, or $HOME/.signature.

       On systems which support new BSD style authentication, the password may
       be  prefixed  by  an  authentication  style  followed  by a colon (i.e.
       "style:password").  See  the  <B>login.conf(5)</B>  for  more  information  on
       authentication styles.



</PRE>
<H2>NOTE ON ETIQUETTE</H2><PRE>
       <I>Xlock</I>  should  not  be  used  on  public terminals when there is a high
       demand for them.

       If you find a public terminal that has been locked by another user  and
       there  are  no  other  terminals available, and the terminal appears to
       have been left idle for a while (normally more than 15 minutes), it  is
       fair to try to reset the session in some manner.

               up in random mode and may be available depending on how it  was
               configured.

       <B>random</B>  Shows a random mode from above except blank (and bomb).


       ‚à<B>‚</B>àí<B>delay</B> <I>usecs</I>
            The  <I>delay</I> option sets the speed at which a mode will operate.  It
            simply sets the number of microseconds to delay between batches of
            animations.   In  blank  mode, it is important to set this to some
            small number of seconds, because the keyboard and mouse  are  only
            checked  after  each  delay, so you cannot set the delay too high,
            but a delay of zero would  needlessly  consume  cpu  checking  for
            mouse  and keyboard input in a tight loop, since blank mode has no
            work to do.

       ‚à<B>‚</B>àí<B>count</B> <I>num</I>
            The <I>batchcount</I> option sets number of <I>things</I> to do per batch to <I>num</I>

       ‚à<B>‚</B>àí<B>batchcount</B> <I>num</I>
            The <I>batchcount</I> option is  deprecated  but  should  still  work  as

       ‚à<B>‚</B>àí<B>size</B> <I>num</I>
            The  <I>size</I> option sets the size maximum size of a star in bouboule,

            lar  to <I>count.</I>  In atunnels, fire, gears, sballs and sproingies it
            is the size of the screen (default 400), this is because  on  many
            slow  systems  it  runs  too slow when the picture covers the full
            screen.  Set to 0 for full screen on fast machines.

       ‚à<B>‚</B>àí<B>ncolors</B> <I>num</I>
            The <I>ncolors</I> option sets the maximum number of colors to be used.

       ‚à<B>‚</B>àí<B>saturation</B> <I>value</I>
            The <I>saturation</I> option sets saturation of the color  ramp  used  to
            <I>value</I>  <I>.</I>   0 is grayscale and 1 is very rich color.  0.4 is a nice
            pastel.

       ‚à<B>‚</B>àí<B>erasemode</B> <I>modename</I>
            As of this writing there are over 12 erase modes supported (if its
            not chosen its assumed random).  The erase modes are random_lines,
            random_squares,  venetian,  triple_wipe,  quad_wipe,  circle_wipe,
            three_circle_wipe,   squaretate,   fizzle,   spiral,  slide_lines,
            losira, no_fade.  <I>modename</I> is now similar to the  option  <B>modelist</B>
            where  you  can  it  can be something like "all‚Äêlosira" to get all
            erasemodes but losira.  Use a "+" or a "," to add modes like "spi‚Äê
            ral+venetian".

       ‚à<B>‚</B>àí<B>erasedelay</B> <I>usecs</I>
            The <I>erasedelay</I> option sets the number of microseconds for steps of
            the <B>erasemode</B> (a setting of 0 and the <B>erasemode</B> is bypassed).

       <B>+/</B>‚Ä<B>‚</B>Äê<B>nolock</B>
            The <I>nolock</I> option causes <B>xlock</B> to only draw the patterns  and  not
            lock the display.  A key press or a mouse click will terminate the
            screen saver.

       ‚Ä<B>‚</B>Äê<B>/+inwindow</B>
            Runs <B>xlock</B> in a window, so that you can iconify, move,  or  resize
            it  and  still use your screen for other stuff.  When running in a
            window, <B>xlock</B> no longer locks your screen, it just looks good.

       ‚Ä<B>‚</B>Äê<B>/+inroot</B>
            Runs <B>xlock</B> in your root window.  Like the <I>inwindow</I>  option  it  no
            longer locks the screen, it just looks good.

       ‚Ä<B>‚</B>Äê<B>/+remote</B>
            The  <I>remote</I> option tells <B>xlock</B> to not stop you from locking remote
            X11 servers.  This option should be used with care and is intended
            mainly  to  lock X11 terminals which cannot run <B>xlock</B> locally.  If
            you lock someone else‚Äôs workstation, they will have to  know  <B>your</B>
            password  to  unlock  it.   Using  <I>+remote</I>  overrides any resource
            derived values for <I>remote</I> and prevents <B>xlock</B> from  being  used  to
            lock  other  X11  servers.   (Use  ‚Äò+‚Äô  instead of ‚Äò‚Äê‚Äô to override
            resources for other options that can take the ‚Äò+‚Äô  modifier  simi‚Äê
            larly.)

       ‚Ä<B>‚</B>Äê<B>/+mono</B>
            The  <I>mono</I>  option  causes  <B>xlock</B> to display monochrome, (black and
            white) pixels rather than the default colored ones on  color  dis‚Äê
            plays.

       ‚Ä<B>‚</B>Äê<B>/+allowaccess</B>
            This  option is required for servers which do not allow clients to
            modify the host access control list.  It is  also  useful  if  you
            need  to  run  x clients on a server which is locked for some rea‚Äê
            son...  When <I>allowaccess</I> is true, the X11 server is left open  for
            clients  to  attach  and thus lowers the inherent security of this
            lock screen.  A side effect of using this option is that if  <B>xlock</B>
            is killed ‚ÄêKILL, the access control list is not lost.

       ‚à<B>‚</B>àí<B>vtlock</B> <I>modename</I>
            This  option is used on a XFree86 system to manage VT switching in
            [off|noswitch|switch|restore] mode.

       <I>off</I>       means no VT switch locking.

       <I>switch</I>    means VT switch locking + switching to xlock  VT  when  acti‚Äê
                 vated.

       <I>restore</I>   means  VT  switch  locking + switching to xlock VT when acti‚Äê
                 vated + switching back to previous VT when desactivated.

       <I>noswitch</I>  means VT switch locking only when xlock VT is active.

       ‚Ä<B>‚</B>Äê<B>/+allowroot</B>
            The <I>allowroot</I> option allows the root password to unlock the server
            as  well  as  the user who started <B>xlock</B>.  May not be able to turn
            this on and off depending on your system and how <B>xlock</B> was config‚Äê
            ured.

       ‚Ä<B>‚</B>Äê<B>/+debug</B>
            Allows <B>xlock</B> to be debugged by doing all but locking the screen.

       ‚Ä<B>‚</B>Äê<B>/+description</B>
            The <I>description</I> option causes <B>xlock</B> shows a mode description above
            password window.  The default is to show this description.

       ‚Ä<B>‚</B>Äê<B>/+echokeys</B>
            The <I>echokeys</I> option causes <B>xlock</B> to echo ‚Äô?‚Äô characters  (default)
            for each key typed into the password prompt.  Some consider this a
            security risk, so the default is to not echo anything.

       ‚à<B>‚</B>àí<B>echokey</B> <I>echokey</I>
            The text character to use for echo key in <I>echokeys</I> <I>.</I>

       ‚Ä<B>‚</B>Äê<B>/+enablesaver</B>
            By default <B>xlock</B> will disable the normal X server‚Äôs  screen  saver
            since  it is in effect a replacement for it.  Since it is possible
            to set delay parameters long enough to cause phosphor burn on some
            displays,  this  option will turn back on the default screen saver
            which is very careful to keep most of the screen black.

       ‚Ä<B>‚</B>Äê<B>/+resetsaver</B>
            By default <B>xlock</B> will call XResetScreenSaver.  This may  be  unde‚Äê
            sirable with DPMS monitors.

       ‚Ä<B>‚</B>Äê<B>/+grabmouse</B>
            The  <I>grabmouse</I> option causes <B>xlock</B> to grab the mouse and keyboard,
            this is the default.  <B>xlock</B> can not lock the screen without  this.

<H2>**WARNING**</H2><PRE>
       <B>xlock</B>  can  appear  to  hang  if  it  is competing with a high‚Äêpriority
       process for the CPU. For example, if <B>xlock</B> is started after  a  process
       with  ‚Äônice  ‚Äê20‚Äô (high priority), <B>xlock</B> will take  considerable amount
       of time to respond.



</PRE>
<H2>SHADOW PASSWORDS</H2><PRE>
       If the machine is using a shadow password system, then <B>xlock</B> may not be
       set  up  to  get the real password and so must be given one of its own.
       This can be either on the command line, via the ‚Ä<B>‚</B>Äê<B>cpasswd</B> option, or  in
       the  file  <B>$HOME/.xlockrc</B>,  with  the first taking precedence.  In both
       cases an encrypted password is expected (see <B>makekey(8)</B>).   If  neither
       is given, then <B>xlock</B> will prompt for a password and will use that, also
       storing an encrypted version of it in <B>$HOME/.xlockrc</B> for future use.



</PRE>
<H2>XLOCK AND SSH‚Ä‚ÄêAGENT</H2><PRE>
       If you use ssh‚Äê<B>agent(1)</B> to avoid entering a passphrase every  time  you
       use  one  of  your  <B>ssh(1)</B> private keys, it‚Äôs good security practice to
       have ssh‚Äêagent forget the keys before you  leave  your  terminal  unat‚Äê
       tended.   That  way,  an attacker who takes over your terminal won‚Äôt be
       able to use your private ssh keys to log in to other systems.  Once you
       return  to  your  terminal, you can enter the passphrase and re‚Äêadd the
       keys to ssh‚Äêagent.  There are a couple of ways in which <B>xlock</B> can  help
       to automate this process.  Firstly, the <I>startCmd</I> option allows <B>xlock</B> to
       be configured to run ‚Äôssh‚Äêadd ‚ÄêD‚Äô every time you lock  the  screen,  so
       that  your  keys  are  automatically  deleted  from  ssh‚Äêagent.  If the
       passphrase on your ssh keys is the same as your  password,  then  <B>xlock</B>
       can  also  be  made to re‚Äêadd the keys to ssh‚Äêagent when you unlock the
       screen, via the <I>pipepassCmd</I> option.  This requires a bit of  scripting,
       as  the  command  must  read your password from standard input and then
       automate the interaction with ssh‚Äêadd to re‚Äêadd the keys.  There is  an
       example of such a script in the <B>xlock</B> distribution ‚Äê see <I>etc/xlockssh*</I>



</PRE>
<H2>BUGS</H2><PRE>
       "kill  ‚ÄêKILL  <B>xlock</B> " causes the server that was locked to be unusable,
       since all hosts (including localhost) were removed from the access con‚Äê
       trol  list  to  lock out new X clients, and since <B>xlock</B> could not catch
       SIGKILL, it terminated before restoring the access control list.   This
       will  leave the X server in a state where <I>"you</I> <I>can</I> <I>no</I> <I>longer</I> <I>connect</I> <I>to</I>
       <I>that</I> <I>server,</I> <I>and</I> <I>this</I> <I>operation</I> <I>cannot</I> <I>be</I> <I>reversed</I> <I>unless</I> <I>you</I> <I>reset</I> <I>the</I>
       <I>server."</I>            ‚ÄêFrom the X11R4 Xlib Documentation, Chapter 7.
       NCD  terminals  do  not  allow  xlock  to remove all the hosts from the
       access control list.  Therefore you will need to use the "‚Äêremote"  and
       "‚Äêallowaccess"  switches.   If you happen to run without "‚Äêallowaccess"
       on an NCD terminal, <B>xlock</B> will not work and you will need to reboot the
       terminal,  or  simply  go  into the SETUP menus, under ‚ÄôNetwork Parame‚Äê
       ters‚Äô, and turn off TCP/IP access control.
