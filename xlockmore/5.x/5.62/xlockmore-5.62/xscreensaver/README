# Previously written for xscreensaver-2.17 and xscreensaver-5.10.
This is now for getting xlockmore modes running in xscreensaver-5.43.
Previous version is way out of date, see below.

First figure out how to compile xscreensaver without my changes.
For me I had to do this:
  install intltool 0.51.0
  libglade-2.0 not found... no demo it warns and no jpeg

Then...
  cp -rp xlockmore-5.59ALPHA5 xsreensaver-5.43/xlockmore
  cd xsreensaver-5.43
  edit configure.in replace 
for d in utils jwxyz hacks hacks/glx driver ; do
for d in utils jwxyz hacks xlockmore/xlock xlockmore/modes xlockmore/modes/glx hacks/glx driver; do
   similar for AC_OUTPUT add these 2 lines after hacks/Makefile
          xlockmore/xlock/Makefile
          xlockmore/modes/Makefile
          xlockmore/modes/glx/Makefile

   autoconf
(I made copies configure.in and configure in this directory, but may go out of date)
  cd xlockmore/xlock
  mv Makefile.inxs Makefile.in
  cd ../modes
  mv Makefile.inxs Makefile.in
  cd glx
  mv Makefile.inxs Makefile.in
  cd ../../..
  ./configure
For me I had to edit the config.h and comment out
/*#define HAVE_GDK_PIXBUF 1*/
add next line
#define HAVE_GTK2 1

 make
 cd hacks
 cp ../xlockmore/xscreensaver/xlockmore.h .  # just edited to add common.h, stuff Jamie forgot about I guess
 cp ../xlockmore/xscreensaver/xlockmoreI.h .  # small edit for recursion_depth
 cp ../xlockmore/xscreensaver/xlockmore.c .  # small edit for blank mode for the completionist
 make xlockmore.o
 cd hacks/glx
 make # may fails so need this also
 make gears
 make rubik
 cd ../../xlockmore/xlock
 make
gives a few warnings
 cd ../modes
 make
New automata.c and automata.h supplied and all automata modes should use this.
(Makefile.inxs modified to use this version already rather than the one in xscreensaver.)
ball, bat, pacman, puzzle converted though it runs it is not working correctly yet
The build should stop with random.c... (no reason to convert that one I guess).
 cd glx
 rm *track* # confuses build
 make
Just a few modes like skewb and biof, for now.  Will stop at cage for wood images.
fire needs its trees and ground images.
I had to add -lpng16 to HACK_POST in Makefile
