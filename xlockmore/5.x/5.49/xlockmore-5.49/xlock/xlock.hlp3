[1mDESCRIPTION[0m
       [1mxlock [22mlocks the X server till the user enters  their  password  at  the
       keyboard.   While  [1mxlock  [22mis  running,  all  new server connections are
       refused.  The screen saver is disabled.  The  mouse  cursor  is  turned
       off.   The  screen  is  blanked  and  a  changing pattern is put on the
       screen.  If a key or a  mouse  button  is  pressed  then  the  user  is
       prompted for the password of the user who started [1mxlock[22m.

       If the correct password is typed, then the screen is unlocked and the X
       server is restored.  When typing the password Control-U  and  Control-H
       are  active  as  kill  and erase respectively.  To return to the locked
       screen, click in the small icon version of the changing pattern.

       In the lower part of the password screen a  text  is  displayed.   This
       message  is  taken  from  the  first file of the following that exists:
       $HOME/.xlocktext, $HOME/.plan, or $HOME/.signature.

       On systems which support new BSD style authentication, the password may
       be  prefixed  by  an  authentication  style  followed  by a colon (i.e.
       "style:password").  See  the  login.conf(5)  for  more  information  on
       authentication styles.


[1mNOTE ON ETIQUETTE[0m
       [4mXlock[24m  should  not  be  used  on  public terminals when there is a high
       demand for them.

       If you find a public terminal that has been locked by another user  and
       there  are  no  other  terminals available, and the terminal appears to
       have been left idle for a while (normally more than 15 minutes), it  is
       fair to try to reset the session in some manner.

       [1m-delay [4m[22musecs[0m
            The  [4mdelay[24m option sets the speed at which a mode will operate.  It
            simply sets the number of microseconds to delay between batches of
            animations.   In  blank  mode, it is important to set this to some
            small number of seconds, because the keyboard and mouse  are  only
            checked  after  each  delay, so you cannot set the delay too high,
            but a delay of zero would  needlessly  consume  cpu  checking  for
            mouse  and keyboard input in a tight loop, since blank mode has no
            work to do.

            A negative [4mcount[24m allows for randomness.  The range from the  mini-
            mum  allowed  nonnegative  [4mcount[24m for a particular mode to the ABS(
            [4mcount[24m ) (or maximum allowed [4mcount[24m , whichever is less).

       [1m-batchcount [4m[22mnum[0m

       [1m-size [4m[22mnum[0m
            The  [4msize[24m option sets the size maximum size of a star in bouboule,
            pyro and star, size of ball in ball and bounce,  size  of  bat  in
            bat,  maximum  size  of  bubble in bubble, size of clock in clock,

            In  flow  and swarm it is the length of the lines.  In atlantis it
            is the shark size.  A negative number allows for randomness, simi-
            lar  to [4mcount.[24m  In atunnels, fire, gears, sballs and sproingies it
            is the size of the screen (default 400), this is because  on  many
            slow  systems  it  runs  too slow when the picture covers the full
            screen.  Set to 0 for full screen on fast machines.

       [1m-ncolors [4m[22mnum[0m
            The [4mncolors[24m option sets the maximum number of colors to be used.

       [1m-saturation [4m[22mvalue[0m
            The [4msaturation[24m option sets saturation of the color  ramp  used  to
            [4mvalue[24m  [4m.[24m   0 is grayscale and 1 is very rich color.  0.4 is a nice
            pastel.

       [1m-erasemode [4m[22mmodename[0m
            As of this writing there are over 12 erase modes supported (if its
            not chosen its assumed random).  The erase modes are random_lines,
            random_squares,  venetian,  triple_wipe,  quad_wipe,  circle_wipe,
            three_circle_wipe,   squaretate,   fizzle,   spiral,  slide_lines,
            losira, no_fade.  [4mmodename[24m is now similar to the  option  [1mmodelist[0m
            where  you  can  it  can be something like "all-losira" to get all
            erasemodes but losira.  Use a "+" or a "," to add modes like "spi-
            ral+venetian".

       [1m-erasedelay [4m[22musecs[0m
            The [4merasedelay[24m option sets the number of microseconds for steps of
            the [1merasemode [22m(a setting of 0 and the [1merasemode [22mis bypassed).

       [1m+/-nolock[0m
            The [4mnolock[24m option causes [1mxlock [22mto only draw the patterns  and  not
            lock the display.  A key press or a mouse click will terminate the
            screen saver.

       [1m-/+inwindow[0m
            Runs [1mxlock [22min a window, so that you can iconify, move,  or  resize
            it  and  still use your screen for other stuff.  When running in a
            window, [1mxlock [22mno longer locks your screen, it just looks good.

       [1m-/+inroot[0m
            Runs [1mxlock [22min your root window.  Like the [4minwindow[24m  option  it  no
            longer locks the screen, it just looks good.

       [1m-/+remote[0m
            The  [4mremote[24m option tells [1mxlock [22mto not stop you from locking remote
            X11 servers.  This option should be used with care and is intended
            mainly  to  lock X11 terminals which cannot run [1mxlock [22mlocally.  If
            you lock someone else's workstation, they will have to  know  [1myour[0m
            password  to  unlock  it.   Using  [4m+remote[24m  overrides any resource
            derived values for [4mremote[24m and prevents [1mxlock [22mfrom  being  used  to
            lock  other  X11  servers.   (Use  `+'  instead of `-' to override
            resources for other options that can take the `+'  modifier  simi-
            larly.)

       [1m-/+mono[0m
            The  [4mmono[24m  option  causes  [1mxlock [22mto display monochrome, (black and
            white) pixels rather than the default colored ones on  color  dis-
            plays.

       [1m-/+allowaccess[0m
            This  option is required for servers which do not allow clients to
            modify the host access control list.  It is  also  useful  if  you
            need  to  run  x clients on a server which is locked for some rea-
            son...  When [4mallowaccess[24m is true, the X11 server is left open  for
            clients  to  attach  and thus lowers the inherent security of this
            lock screen.  A side effect of using this option is that if  [1mxlock[0m
            is killed -KILL, the access control list is not lost.

       [1m-vtlock [4m[22mmodename[0m
            This  option is used on a XFree86 system to manage VT switching in
            [off|noswitch|switch|restore] mode.

       [4moff[24m       means no VT switch locking.

       [4mswitch[24m    means VT switch locking + switching to xlock  VT  when  acti-
                 vated.

       [4mrestore[24m   means  VT  switch  locking + switching to xlock VT when acti-
                 vated + switching back to previous VT when desactivated.

       [4mnoswitch[24m  means VT switch locking only when xlock VT is active.

       [1m-/+allowroot[0m
            The [4mallowroot[24m option allows the root password to unlock the server
            as  well  as  the user who started [1mxlock[22m.  May not be able to turn
            this on and off depending on your system and how [1mxlock [22mwas config-
            ured.

       [1m-/+debug[0m
            Allows [1mxlock [22mto be debugged by doing all but locking the screen.

       [1m-/+description[0m
            The [4mdescription[24m option causes [1mxlock [22mshows a mode description above
            password window.  The default is to show this description.

       [1m-/+echokeys[0m
            The [4mechokeys[24m option causes [1mxlock [22mto echo '?' characters  (default)
            for each key typed into the password prompt.  Some consider this a
            security risk, so the default is to not echo anything.

       [1m-echokey [4m[22mechokey[0m
            The text character to use for echo key in [4mechokeys[24m [4m.[0m

       [1m-/+enablesaver[0m
            By default [1mxlock [22mwill disable the normal X server's  screen  saver
            since  it is in effect a replacement for it.  Since it is possible
            to set delay parameters long enough to cause phosphor burn on some
            displays,  this  option will turn back on the default screen saver

            The  rule string is defined as S<neighborhood>/B<neighborhood> for
            [4mlife[24m and [4mlife3d.[24m  Special parameters: P, picks a random rule  from
            all  rules  that  have known patterns; G, picks a random rule from
            all rules that have known gliders.  For [4mlife[24m  a  good  example  is
            Conway's   rule   which   is   S23/B3.   Others  are  B36/S23  and
            B3678/S34678.  For [4mlife3d[24m good examples are Bay's rules which  are
            S45/B5,  S567/B6, S56/B5, and S67/B67.  The rule string is defined
            as a binary string (requires at least one 1 and one 0) for [4mant[24m and
            a base 4 (or quadranary) string (requires 3 of 4 digits to be rep-
            resented) for [4mant3d.[24m  Here a special parameter, T and then a  num-
            ber, will pick a specific table.

[1m**WARNING**[0m
       [1mxlock [22mcan appear to hang  if  it  is  competing  with  a  high-priority
       process  for  the CPU. For example, if [1mxlock [22mis started after a process
       with 'nice -20' (high priority), [1mxlock [22mwill take   considerable  amount
       of time to respond.


[1mSHADOW PASSWORDS[0m
       If the machine is using a shadow password system, then [1mxlock [22mmay not be
       set up to get the real password and so must be given one  of  its  own.
       This  can be either on the command line, via the [1m-cpasswd [22moption, or in
       the file [1m$HOME/.xlockrc[22m, with the first  taking  precedence.   In  both
       cases  an  encrypted password is expected (see makekey(8)).  If neither
       is given, then [1mxlock [22mwill prompt for a password and will use that, also
       storing an encrypted version of it in [1m$HOME/.xlockrc [22mfor future use.


[1mXLOCK AND SSH-AGENT[0m
       If  you  use ssh-agent(1) to avoid entering a passphrase every time you
       use one of your ssh(1) private keys, it's  good  security  practice  to
       have  ssh-agent  forget  the  keys before you leave your terminal unat-
       tended.  That way, an attacker who takes over your  terminal  won't  be
       able to use your private ssh keys to log in to other systems.  Once you
       return to your terminal, you can enter the passphrase  and  re-add  the
       keys  to ssh-agent.  There are a couple of ways in which [1mxlock [22mcan help
       to automate this process.  Firstly, the [4mstartCmd[24m option allows [1mxlock [22mto
       be  configured  to  run 'ssh-add -D' every time you lock the screen, so
       that your keys  are  automatically  deleted  from  ssh-agent.   If  the
       passphrase  on  your  ssh keys is the same as your password, then [1mxlock[0m
       can also be made to re-add the keys to ssh-agent when  you  unlock  the
       screen,  via the [4mpipepassCmd[24m option.  This requires a bit of scripting,
       as the command must read your password from  standard  input  and  then
       automate  the interaction with ssh-add to re-add the keys.  There is an
       example of such a script in the [1mxlock [22mdistribution - see [4metc/xlockssh*[0m


[1mBUGS[0m
       "kill -KILL [1mxlock [22m" causes the server that was locked to  be  unusable,
       since all hosts (including localhost) were removed from the access con-
       trol list to lock out new X clients, and since [1mxlock  [22mcould  not  catch
       SIGKILL,  it terminated before restoring the access control list.  This
       will leave the X server in a state where [4m"you[24m [4mcan[24m [4mno[24m [4mlonger[24m [4mconnect[24m  [4mto[0m

       NCD terminals do not allow xlock to  remove  all  the  hosts  from  the
       access  control list.  Therefore you will need to use the "-remote" and
       "-allowaccess" switches.  If you happen to run  without  "-allowaccess"
       on an NCD terminal, [1mxlock [22mwill not work and you will need to reboot the
       terminal, or simply go into the SETUP  menus,  under  'Network  Parame-
       ters', and turn off TCP/IP access control.
