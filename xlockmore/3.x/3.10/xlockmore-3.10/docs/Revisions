xlockmore-3.10 as of 06 August 1996, the maintained version of xlock
Adapted from Patrick J. Naughton's original xlock
Primary site: ftp.x.org in /contrib/applications
Secondary site: sunsite.unc.edu in /pub/Linux/X11/xutils/screensavers
Maintainer: David A. Bagley <bagleyd@hertz.njit.edu>

Make sure you use the new XLock.ad resource file (or at remove the old one)
otherwise several modes will not be set up nicely.  This is usually put as a
file in $HOME/XLock and/or $WHEREVER_X11_IS_LOADED/lib/app-defaults/XLock .

3.10
  Reorganized bitmaps.  All single bitmaps use "image_" inside the bitmap
    file.  They are now organized t-tiny, s-small, m-medium, and l-large.
    That way one can, if one wished, one can use one bitmap file for eyes,
    image, life, life1d, maze, and puzzle at compile-time.
  Removed all references to Scr, screen, and dsp in the modes.
  Release mode stuff added to all modes (except random).  Rewrote image
    initialization for bat, image, and puzzle to make it safe for
    multiscreens (image and puzzle are still not correct for multiscreens).
  Negative batchcounts now allowed, if negative it will be random from
    the smallest allowed positive batchcount to ABS(batchcount), inclusive.
    It is available on
      ant, bat, bounce, bug, eyes, flag, galaxy, geometry, grav, image, laser,
      lissie, maze, mountain, petal, puzzle, rock, spiral, spline, swarm,
      world, worm.
  More mallocing (and freeing) done for bat, bounce, bug, eyes, galaxy,
    geometry, image, lissie, maze, puzzle, rock, rotor, spline, wator, world,
    worm, so there are less predefined limits.  In the case of eyes and rock,
    some limits were imposed where a dynamic number of pixmaps were
    dynamically declared, so that xlock would not easily slow down to a crawl
    and run out of memory.
  bug now uses gridsize.  And to some degree life, life1d, and wator.
    It would be neat if you could choose not to use the bitmaps for big
    windows.
  worm now uses cycles for length of worm and galaxy uses cycles now too.
    rock uses cycles for max rock size.
  One no longer has to hit return twice to unlock using lockdelay.
  flag now uses batchcount for "point" size.
  XClearWindow is used instead of filling screen with a big black rectangle.
  Added -icongeometry option. It has a range of 1x1 to 256x256 .  Position
    information is ignored.  Updated modes to handle weird geometry's bat,
    bounce, braid, bug, eyes, kaleid, life, life1d, maze, nose, puzzle,
    wator, world.
  mountain changed to allow it to be interrupted quicker, (braid and slip
    are harder :) ).
  bounce changed to get rid of drawing errors.  I could not figure out how
    easily remove more without the balls flashing.
  wire mode added based on code from Kevin Dahlhausen <ap096@po.cwru.edu>
    and Stefan Strack <stst@vuse.vanderbilt.edu>.
  lightning mode added thanks to Keith Romberg <kromberg@saxe.com>.
  in xlock.c, in function runMainLoop, reads should be declared not as
    struct fd_set.  This causes compilation errors with Linux kernels 2.0
    and higher.  Thanks to Brian R. Doherty <doherty@rice.edu>.
  "nice" patch for xlock to so that xlock is "not so nice" when a password
    window is being presented.  Thanks to Jouk Jansen
    <joukj@crys.chem.uva.nl>.
  lightning, eyes, maze, shape patched for multiscreens.  XPM stuff patched
    for multiscreens (thanks to XPM maintainer Arnaud Le Hors).
    Tested on a machine where 0.0 is black/white, 0.1 is 8 bit color.
    Also random mode does not use the correct initial values of modes on
    multiscreens.  Testing on multiscreen thanks to Mark Wedel
    <mwedel@pyramid.com>.
  Long standing bug fixed (>= before MAXBATCH) for flame.c thanks to Ron
    Charlton <crc@ornl.gov>.
  puzzle when in -inwindow or compiled with -DDEBUG and moved off screen
    will not bomb out unless it is using an xbm image.  This should be
    completely fixed in 3.11.
  New defaults: grelb substituted for life icon, -install for 
    installation of the colormap, some modes slowed down so they would look
    correct on fast machines.
 
3.9
  All modes (except eyes.c) have been updated to use less global variables.
    Also updated xlockmore to ANSI C by GNU's protoize.
  demon.c updated to be faster.  Although it is now significantly more
    complicated.
  ant.c and demon now have runtime options.   -neighbors 6 or 4 (default = 4)
    -gridsize (170 default)  (In ant, when neighbors = 6 it is called bees.
    Not much is known about these criters.  They do not seem to exibit the
    highway building activity found in normal ants, but otherwise they
    behave pretty similar.)
  flag mode thanks to Charles Vidal <vidalc@univ-mlv.fr>.
  The Lissajous worm (lissie mode) thanks to Alexander Jolk
    <ub9x@rz.uni-karlsruhe.de>.
  Shape mode now has triangles.  Also now looks better when minimized.
    From an idea in REC (Recreational & Educational Computing).
  Random mode now tells you which mode is running when run with -v.
    Added VERBOSE stuff to life, life3d, life1d, and ant.
  Changed rock.c to use blue by default for the left eye.  All 3D glasses
    I have seen use blue.
  Fixed swirl so it would not swirl "white".  Even if it is not a bg or fg
    color.  This made the border around the little window change color.
  From Ron Hitchens <ron@utw.com>:
    patch for middle button so that it will change locks even if duration
      is 0 in random mode.
    patch for window title noticable when used with the -inwindow option.
    fixed up demon.c
  Random access to raster files by giving a directory thanks to Jouk
    Jansen <joukj@alpha.chem.uva.nl>.  If UNIX, give directory followed by
    a "/", also it may try to put "." as an image file.
  When xlock is compiled with shadow passwords it will still work on non
    shadowed systems that use elf, thanks to Marek Michalkiewicz
    <marekm@i17linuxb.ists.pwr.wroc.pl>  Compilation with HAS_SHADOW is
    forced on Linux with ELF (even if shadow passwording is not used).
    This will facilitate a migration towards shadow passwording.
  For the sake of completeness, xbm files can now be read in at run-time.
    Courtesy of John Bradley's xv(xvbm.c), used by permission.
  "xlock -nolock -lockdelay 1" should no longer crash

3.8
  system call for sounds using DEF_PLAY thanks to Milco Numan
    <milcon@krim.chem.uva.nl>
  Used GNU's indent to reformat all *.c and *.h files.  It may have
    screwed up some comments. I used:
    -bap -nbacc -bad -nbc -br -bs -c33 -cd33 -ncdb -ce
    -d0 -di12 -neei -fc1 -i8 -ip8 -l79 -lp -npcs -psl -nsc -nsob
    -cli8 -cs -cp1
  Multiple root accounts for allowroot.  Thanks to Lewis Muhlenkamp
    <lewism@tt.comm.mot.com>.
  Better make.com file for for VMS thanks to Jouk Jansen and the
    author of XVMSUTILS, Trevor Taylor <taylort@decus.com.au>.
  -display fix for VAX thanks to Jouk Jansen.
  eyes mode, revamp to eliminate need for global variables in modes,
    new hooks (release and refresh), and middle button for "Next" in
    random mode, thanks to Ron Hitchens <ron@utw.com>.
    This now allows for many things to be cleaned up.  Due to the number
    of modes, it will take a few releases.  See HACKERS.GUIDE.
  puzzle mode thanks to Heath Rice <hrice@netcom.com> & Jouk Jansen
    <joukj@alpha.chem.uva.nl>.
  Raster files (for puzzle.c and image.c) thanks to Tobias Gloth
    <gloth@math.uni-muenster.de> & Jouk Jansen <joukj@alpha.chem.uva.nl>.
    Background is now black when used with -install.
  swirl for 16 bytes per pixel patch <davidm@azstarnet.com>
  bouboule mode memory leaks fixed thanks to Jeremie Petit <jpetit@essi.fr>.
  maze's dead ends are now filled in.
  More syslog stuff for notifying failures in unlocking xlock Andrew Sammut
    <sammut@dstc.qut.edu.au>.
  blank now uses the power-down sleep mode if available, thanks to Ron
    Hitchens <ron@utw.com>.

3.7
  HP bug timing bug fixed thanks to Ron Hitchens <ron@utw.com>.
  3D mode for rock thanks to <theiling@coli.uni-sb.de>.

  added compile time option for spline, FOLLOW to erase old splines
    like Qix thanks to Richard Duran <rduran@cs.utep.edu>
  petal now works with -inroot .
  CDE DT saver thanks to Trevor Bourget <trevor@thomsoft.com>
    see Imakefile and README.
  bouboule mode added, thanks to Jeremie Petit <jpetit@essi.fr>.
    bouboule fixed for VMS and TrueColor.

    xlock now appears over the screensaver, passwd.c reorganized,
    new event loop in xlock.c, new icons in bitmaps, updated clock
    and triangle, and resource parsing fixed for "xlock".
  pedal renamed to petal.

    Petit Jeremie <jpetit@essi.fr>.
  More context handling stuff for DCE thanks to Terje Marthinussen
    <terjem@cc.uit.no>.
  slip mode added thanks to Scott Draves <spot@cs.cmu.edu>
    with a patch from <joukj@alpha.chem.uva.nl>.
  patch for -messagesfile code favored early quotes and new event loop
    compatability thanks to <joukj@alpha.chem.uva.nl>.
  XLock.ad and xlock.man updated to be more consistent.
  ultrix fix for strdup thanks to Erik Bertelsen <erik@sockdev.uni-c.dk>.
  invalid sound added thanks to <J.M.Box@dcs.warwick.ac.uk>
  Thanks to <mccomb@interport.net> for helping to debug marquee and nose
    on multiheaded machines.
 
3.5
  Fixed my goof on worm.c.
  vms_play fixed for nonexisting sound files and -messagesfile code

  marquee now more random and memmove no longer used.
  marquee fixed for multiheaded machines thanks to Caleb Epstein
    <epstein_caleb@jpmorgan.com>.
  Random number generator fixed for 64 bit "long" thanks to Scott McCoy
    <smccoy@dr3w.ess.harris.com>.

3.4
  rplay patch thanks to Simon Banks <sbanks@cellnet.co.uk>.  xlock now
    has sound where available.  Edit your favorite makefile.
  2 new modes thanks to Tobias Gloth <gloth@math.uni-muenster.de>.
    marquee (I changed a lot) shows text on the screen, similar to nose
    triangle, (colormaping removed) similar to mountain
  nose text functions removed to utils.c
  image.c now with -imagefile option (only with XPM).
  rect.c name changed to shape.c.
  swirl.c and world.c fixed for multiscreens, thanks to Grant McDorman
    <grant@isgtec.com>.
  A better way of handling fortunes from a file, thanks to Jouk Jansen
    <joukj@alpha.chem.uva.nl>.  To try use -messagesfile fortune.dat.
    Also contributed vms_play.c and a new make.com file.
  KERBEROS patch thanks to Omar Siddique <omar@gl.umbc.edu> for sending
    and testing it (patch author unknown).

3.3
  LIFE_5655 and LIFE_6767 compile time options for life3d.
  ultrix passwd bug fix thanks to Erik Bertelsen <erik@sockdev.uni-c.dk>.
  nose now has a font option and is fixed for multiscreens.
  Stupid memory leak in ant fixed.  Now random colors.
  swirl now needs to be used with -install to look right,
    thanks to Heath A. Kehoe <hakehoe@icaen.uiowa.edu>.
  Patch for AIX thanks to Jouk Jansen <joukj@crys.chem.uva.nl>.
  Color pixmaps for bat from <patol@info.isbiel.ch>.
  image pixmaps now default to bitmaps if xpm fails, thanks to
    <Markus.Zellner@anu.edu.au>.
  flame crashed xlock when using random mode on Linux, fixed.
  Numerous fixes for multiscreens incl: bat, bounce, rect, hyper, life1d,
    forest, laser, mountain, and braid.  Also xlock.c patched or second
    screen would have a black and white display.
    Purify found memory leaks in swirl, mountain, laser, hyper, maze.
    Thanks to <mccomb@interport.net>.
  New option -lockdelay #, for those who were bothered by xautolock
    locking the screen when you you did not want it, now just hit
    return (within a specified number of seconds) to get the screen back.
    This option is intended to be used with xautolock.
  worm now has no limit on the number of worms.
  pyro bug fixed for large batchcount (500-2000), thanks to
    Minoura Makoto <minoura@flab.fujitsu.co.jp>.

3.2
  Doug McLaren <dougmc@comco.com> noticed a big security hole in
    nose.c when xlock is setuid to root.  Now, after the password is
    read, it gives up root, thanks to Heath A. Kehoe
    <hakehoe@icaen.uiowa.edu>.
  DCE Authentication patch added.
  Thanks to Jouk Jansen <joukj@crys.chem.uva.nl> for clearing up
    a timing problem using -DOLD_EVENT_LOOP .

3.1
  Multipatch by Heath A. Kehoe <hakehoe@icaen.uiowa.edu> it includes
    speed up in helix, random mode now switches modes, input to mode
    is now customizable (see random.c), and a DCE authentication patch
    (based on work by Phil O'Connell <philo@icaen.uiowa.edu>).  Also
    usleep was dropped in favor of a new timing mechanism.  It is still
    available using -DOLD_EVENT_LOOP (VMS still uses it by default).
  braid.c thanks to John Neil <neil@math.idbsu.edu>.
  helix now looks even better.  I found a bug in the translation from
    xscreensaver.
  nose.c may still need a little work (its a bit slow).  Taken from 2
    sources xnlock and xscreensaver's noseguy.  It no longer leaves
    dust on the screen as well (the bitmaps are shifted up by one pixel).
  pedal.c taken from xscreensaver.
  Patches for OSF1_ENH_SEC but it unfortunately seems to need more work.
  Idea to have the mode.h defaults used thanks to Roland Bock
    <exp120@physik.uni-kiel.d400.de>.
  closedown patch for xdm use from Janet Carson's xclosedown
    with modifications from Anthony Thyssen <anthony@cit.gu.edu.au>.
  image.c updated to use xbm if using a monochrome monitor or using -mono.
  life1d, bug.c, ant.c, and demon.c added from Scientific American's
    Computer Recreations.
  hop.c now has Peter de Jong's hop.  Half the time its boring but
    the other half of the time its great.
  A better patch from Peter Schmitzberger <schmitz@coma.sbg.ac.at> for
    spiral (a bug that I introduced).

3.0
  Patch from Peter Schmitzberger <schmitz@coma.sbg.ac.at> for maze and image.
  Thanks to Shane Watts <shane@phobes.mlckew.edu.au> for helping me with
    Linux shadowing.
  world.c backward spinning jump fixed by Neale Pickett <zephyr@nmt.edu>.
  laser.c bug (that I introduced) solved by Heath A. Kehoe
    <hakehoe@icaen.uiowa.edu>.
  Edited rect so that it does ellipses as well, like After Dark.
    I should of renamed it right?
  Got rid of "+=" in Imakefile because HP, AIX, and Ultrix have
    trouble with it.  Still used by some systems where there seems to
    be no trouble.
  passwd.c extracted from xlock.c and xlock.h .  May have cured some
    bugs (like a BIG network security bug) but most likely broke some
    systems.  Thanks for the many people who gave feedback during
    the BETA test.
  
2.10
  xlockrc password for more user control of xlock.  Author unknown.
    It is a compile-time option, see Imakefile and README.
    Moved usleep.c and hsbramp.c to utils.c and logout.c to opt.c .
    Split out mode.h from resource.c .
  Changes of Skip_Burrell@sterling.com were incorporated into image.c .
    Not sure how to get pixmaps to randomize color and -mono does
    not work for pixmaps.  See Imakefile and README.
  -allowroot now works on Solaris2.x.
  Clock mode added, thanks to Jeremie Petit <petit@simula.unice.fr>.
  laser and mountain modes added, similar to After Dark's version, and
    also forest mode thanks to Pascal Pensa <pensa@aurora.unice.fr>.
  Updated maze and helix after seeing mountain mode.  Don't have to
    wait a second to enter password. :)
  Now provide random number generator.  Thanks to Mike Arras
    <arras@intertv.com>.  I changed RAND to LRAND.
  Due to overwhelming demand, the old flame is back... well OK its
    slightly modified.
  Patch for SUNOS_ADJUNCT_PASSWD, thanks to Dale A. Harris
    <rodmur@ecst.csuchico.edu>.
  Imakefile reorganized for AIX.

2.9
  "make install.man" should now work for imake users (if you would like
   it to work for Makefile.hp ...  mail me the patch).  
  Unbundled SunC warnings removed in bitmap files, maze, grav, life,
    and swirl.
  Swirl patched to work sensibly with TrueColor displays, thanks to
    Steve Early <sde1000@cam.ac.uk>
  Rock mode made much better by Jeremie Petit <petit@simula.unice.fr>.
  Imakefile reorganized by <mjacob@feral.COM> for Solaris2.x .
  Reorganized the README and the screens are now (mostly) alphabetical
    throughout.
  Updated life3d to include compile-time options LIFE_5766 and LIFE_4555.
    5766 is more like life, but 4555 (default) seems to be better.
  I went through the lifep.zip (May 94) collection and pulled out some
    small and interesting life forms.
  I added another control to the screens.  "-cycles num" influences the
    time out (it applies to about a 1/3 of the screens, see man pages).
    For consistency, the meaning of batchcount for qix, life, life3d,
    and rect was changed.  References to "seconds()" in the screens were
    removed.  The length of a "cycle" depends on "delay".
  Multidisplay bug fix for maze, thanks to <epstein_caleb@jpmorgan.com>.
  AIXV3 with AFS, thanks to <chuck_hines@VNET.IBM.COM>.

2.8
  No more bomb.c, if you think xlock needs it, let the maintainer know.
  full_lock rewritten by Dale A. Harris <rodmur@ecst.csuchico.edu> to
    handle non-login groups as well.
  fixed a bug in wator, introduced in 2.7.
  fixed nanosleep bug for delays of 1 second or more.  Nanosleep is now
    used by default on Solaris.  The Imakefile will have to be modified
    if using Solaris 2.0-2.2, since nanosleep is not available.
  I do not know why, but the logout out feature now works on Solaris.
  Various warnings and errors fixed in make.com, resource.c, logout.c,
    and galaxy.c for VMS.  Also fixed random generator for VMS not to
    toggle the least significant bit.  This made worm.c look funny.
  xlock now works on VMS/AXP thanks to <JOUKJ@CRYS.CHEM.UVA.NL>.  One
    will have to uncomment sections in make.com .  Also fixed some
    AIX problems.
  Modes spiral and geometry thanks to Darrick Brown <dbrown@cs.hope.edu>.
    Batchcount in maze and spline were changed to behave similarly.
  A patch from Heath Rice <hrice@netcom.com> for a better way to handle
    batchcount, delay, and saturation.
  I went through xlife3.0 huge collection and added "suitable" lifeforms.

2.7
  sgi patches and logos from Dave Truesdell <truesdel@nas.nasa.gov>.
  flame bug fixed thanks to <spot@cs.cmu.edu> and
    <M.R.Dobie@ecs.soton.ac.uk>.
  MANY patches from Heath A. Kehoe <hakehoe@icaen.uiowa.edu> include:
    The long awaited HP patch.  It appears there was a bug in HP's XFlush
    function.  So XSync was substituted.  HP_PASSWDETC patch.
    maze, swarm, and worm -mono now look better.
    Many changes to the Imakefile, new compile time features ...
    including a logout button for labs (this appears to be better
    implementation than the bomb mode (much of the bomb code has been
    reused)) -install option to allow xlock to install its own colormap
    if it runs out of colors.
  Thanks to <slouken@virtbrew.water.ca.gov> for yet another option:
    grabmouse for compatablilty with xscreensaver.  So you would set
    your apps-defaults file for xscreensaver like:

*programs:      xlock -nolock +grabmouse -mode random

  Updated life3d to include shooting gliders.
  BSD and Linux icons slightly modified.  Also new ships for life.
  Compile time options HAS_RAND, HAS_RANDOM, and HAS_RAND48, and
    updated the sccsid so `what` will give you something meaningful.

2.6
  Created a HAS_USLEEP and a USE_VROOT switch.
    There were numerous reports of the incompatibility with tvtwm,
    (also problems with windows with StickyAbove set to true and
    swirl), read the README section on that.
  Thanks to Chris Ross <cross@va.pubnix.com>, maintainer of tvtwm, for
    fixing various bugs; make depend for R5 and less, life3d should not
    have malloc.h, and a time-elapsed patch. 
  A few new life forms for life.c.  Anyone know what SMILEY is really
    supposed to look like?  :)
  Revised -inroot does not lock screen, as this is done better with the
    following patch, and as someone pointed out, its not intuitive.
  Thanks to Tim Medley for sending the -geometry patch of Mike Peercy
    <peercy@crhc.uiuc.edu>.  Many of the modes will fail if the windows
    are far from square or are too small.  You can place Xlock off the
    screen, for example,
      xlock -enablesaver -mode blank -geometry +1152+0
    puts the window off the visible screen on a Sun.
  A new version of flame.c from the original author Scott Draves
    <spot@cs.cmu.edu>.
  Something really devilish for BSD (new icons) thanks to J Wunsch
    <j@uriah.sax.de>, but they have been modified.  I also created a
    Linux icon.
  A patch for Ultrix systems (at least DECstations) running enhanced     
    security thanks to Chris Fuhrman <cfuhrman@vt.edu> and friend.
  Multidisplay bug fix for life3d and wator, thanks to
    <epstein_caleb@jpmorgan.com>.
  Life3d on a monochrome monitor looks a little better. -mono was
    working right.

2.5
  A patch for swirl for fixed color maps (more colorful) and the
    image now spirals outwards from the center with a fixed number of
    points drawn every iteration, thanks to <M.R.Dobie@ecs.soton.ac.uk>.
  A patch for blot on dual-headed machines and nanosleep, thanks to
    Greg Onufer <Greg.Onufer@Eng.Sun.COM>. Use nanosleep on Solaris2.3
    and greater, examine the Imakefile and/or README for details.
  A long needed patch for X11R5+ for -delay, -batchcount, and
    -saturation to work thanks to Patrick D Sullivan <pds@bss.com>.
  bomb mode patch for more flexibility thanks to Dave Shield
    <D.T.Shield@csc.liv.ac.uk>.
  bomb mode patch for Sun10 thanks to Nicolas Pioch <pioch@Email.ENST.Fr>.
  modes wator and life3d added.
  life now has a random soup pattern stolen from life3d.
  -inroot option added, thanks to Bill Woodward <wpwood@pencom.com>.
    Now more compatible with xscreensaver if run as
    "xlock -mode kaleid -inroot -nolock".

2.4
  hopalong now includes a sine hop (but less likely to come up).
  life now has new organisms. They are now better centered.  Some of
   the nonperiodic forms were removed.
   life's gliders now come from the edge of the screen, usually.
  image now centers icons, for example, the hp icon is now centered.
  blot now randomly has xsym, ysym, or both.
  Solaris should now compile out of the box to handle shadow passwords.
    Thanks to Alain Brossard <brossard@siisun.epfl.ch>.
  rock, grav, rect, bat, world, bounce and swirl fix for 24 bit colors.
  Patch for building under HP-UX with Secured Passwords, thanks to
    Dale Harris <rodmur@ecst.csuchico.edu>.

2.3
  Now the X Logo displays if not Sun or HP.
  "bat" mode disastrous bug fixed.  Thanks to R.K.Lloyd@csc.liv.ac.uk
    for pointing it out.
  -DMOUSE_MOTION switch added for those who want the Password window to
    come up if you just moved the mouse. (Not recommended).
  "swirl" mode was modified to check background, foreground, and black
    so as not to cycle these colors, special thanks to Mark Dobie
    <mrd@ecs.soton.ac.uk>.
  -DFORCEFIXEDCOLORS switch for those who are annoyed by swirl cycling
    its colors.

2.2
  Made more consistent with the slackware release.  XLock.ad changes
    to rock, rotor, and foreground and background colors.
  Fixed bug in life.c, evident in the Slackware release.
  Minor patch for swirl on HP's due to R.K.Lloyd@csc.liv.ac.uk.
  "bat" put back with minor changes.

2.1
  Large modifications to README.
  Patch for building under QNX 4.2 w/ Metrolink X server, thanks to
    Brian Campbell <brianc@qnx.com>.

2.0
  "swirl" mode was added, thanks to Mark Dobie <mrd@ecs.soton.ac.uk>.
    WOW, but not-so-neat on monochrome monitors.
  Patch for Solaris 2.3 for local, NIS, and NIS+ passwords, thanks to
    <Christian.Iseli@di.epfl.ch>.
  "image" mode was put back but random will not run it, too boring.
  "bomb" mode was added, thanks to <D.T.Shield@compsci.liverpool.ac.uk>.
  In order to use extra-long passwords with the Linux, changed
    PASSLENGTH from 20 to 64.  Thanks to <slouken@virtbrew.water.ca.gov>.

1.14
  Multidisplay bug fix for rect, thanks to <epstein_caleb@jpmorgan.com>.
  Now works on IRIX on the SGI. Thanks to <reggers@julian.uwo.ca>.
  Now works on NetBSD. Thanks to Greg Earle <earle@isolar.Tujunga.CA.US>.
  Now works on a Alpha 3000/400 OSF/1 V2.0. Thanks to Udo Linauer
    <ul@eacpc4.tuwien.ac.at>.
  "galaxy" mode was added, thanks to Hubert Feyrer
    <hubert.feyrer@rz.uni-regensburg.de>.
  "kaleid" mode was added, taken from the Linux version of xkaleid.
  
1.13
  "timeelapsed" option was added.  Allows you to find out how long a
    machine is locked so you can complain to an administrator.
  Now may work on IRIX on the SGI. Thanks to Thomas Runge
    <runge@egd.igd.fhg.de>
  "bat" mode was added, thanks to Lorenzo Patocchi <patol@info.isbiel.ch>.

1.12
  xlock now works on Linux with shadow passwords.  Special thanks to
    H. J. Dihu <macgyver@mcs.com>

1.11
  Shadow passwords and DES encryption are now detected by the Imakefile.
    Victor Langeveld <vic@mbfys.kun.nl> reorganized the Imakefile for 
    shadow passwords and crypt.  Now should compile "right out of the
    box" (although there are still problems on Solaris 2.3).
  Patch to fix sudden rotation changes in rock from Yoshiaki Kasahara
    <kasahara@csce.kyushu-u.ac.jp>.

1.10
  R.K.Lloyd@csc.liv.ac.uk reorganized the Imakefile yet again.
  Fixed a bug in rect.c thanks to <epstein_caleb@jpmorgan.com>.
  Ditched bzero and bcopy since both are more generally available as
    memset and memcpy.  Also removed some lint warnings.

1.9
  "rect" mode was added from xscreensaver's greynetic.
  "helix" bug fixed.  It is now more interesting.
  bounce.c divide by zero fixed and grav.c improvements.  Thanks to Greg
    Bowering <greg@cs.adelaide.edu.au>.
  grav.c, rock.c, world.c fixed so no black objects.

1.8
  Imakefile did not work with R6.  Also Solaris2.3 may use SVR4
    instead of SYSV.  Thanks to Chris P. Ross <cross@eng.umd.edu>
  "grav" mode was added.  Its a simplistic gravitational simulation,
    with (currently a constant 16) solid spheres (non-renderd) of equal
    size and mass orbiting a fixed central mass.  The sphere's orbit in
    3 dimensions, their position and size being projected with simple
    perspective.  Thanks to Greg Bowering <greg@cs.adelaide.edu.au>.
  "inwindow" option was added.  Allows you to do what xlock already
    did when DEBUG was defined.  It no longer locks your screen, but
    allows you to run xlock as a (somewhat distracting) decoration.
    Thanks to Greg Bowering <greg@cs.adelaide.edu.au>.
  "bounce" mode (football) is back.
  "world" mode was added.  Thanks to Matthew Moyle-Croft
    <mmc@cs.adelaide.edu.au>
  "image" mode was removed. It was very similar to world anyway.

1.7
  cuserid() is needed by Solaris2.3 with shadow passwords in xlock.c.
    Thanks to Bill <benedett@gentire.com>.

1.6
  R.K.Lloyd@csc.liv.ac.uk pointed out again that gray_bits in maze.c needs
    a type cast.
  xlock.c defaults to "blank" to minimize cpu usage on a network.

1.5
  xlock works again on VMS (see README.VMS) thanks to Anthony Clarke
    <Anthony.D.Clarke@Support.Hatfield.Raytheon.bae.eurokom.ie>.
  memcpy and memset definitions for SYSV. Also there now is a switch
    for shadow passwords thanks to <reggers@julian.uwo.ca>.

1.4
  Now works on BSD. Thanks to Victor Langeveld <vic@mbfys.kun.nl>
  Both Victor and Alexandre Miguel <miguel@natacha.ens-cachan.fr>
    suggested taking out the cuserid() call in xlock.c.  For FreeBSD its
    a necessity and the old way is is a security hole in SunOS.

1.3
  Linux port from Darren Senn's (sinster@scintilla.capitola.ca.us) xlock.
  Fixed drand to random in helix.c
  Fixed a memory leak in rock.c.

1.2
  SHIFT - CONTROL - BREAK on the HP is trapped. Thanks to
  R.K.Lloyd@csc.liv.ac.uk who pointed out that this was done in xscreensaver.
  AIXV3 and HP bugs fixed, again due to R. K. Lloyd.

1.1 & 1.0
  took out "rint" from "worm.c" since HP's have trouble with it
  added spline, maze, sphere, hyper, helix, rock, & blot modes.
  fixed "xlock.h" and "usleep" for the HP.
  changed border so it varies with size of screen on "swarm" so the
    wasp would not be stuck in a corner when the password is entered.
