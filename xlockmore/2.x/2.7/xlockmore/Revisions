Note:
  Unless I hear an objection, bomb.c will vanish with 2.8.

2.7
  sgi patches and logos from Dave Truesdell <truesdel@nas.nasa.gov>.
  flame bug fixed thanks to <spot@cs.cmu.edu> and
    <M.R.Dobie@ecs.soton.ac.uk>.
  MANY patches from Heath A. Kehoe <hakehoe@icaen.uiowa.edu> include:
    The long awaited HP patch.  It appears there was a bug in HP's XFlush
    function.  So XSync was substituted.
    maze, swarm, and worm -mono now look better.
    Many changes to the Imakefile, new compile time features ...
    including a logout button for labs (this appears to be better
    implementation than the bomb mode (much of the bomb code has been
    reused).  Unfortunately, the logout no longer works on Solaris.)
    -install option to allow xlock to install its own colormap if it
    runs out of colors.
  Thanks to <slouken@virtbrew.water.ca.gov> for yet another option:
    grabmouse for comatablilty with xscreensaver.  So you would set
    your apps-defaults file for xscreensaver like:

*programs:      xlock -nolock +grabmouse -mode random

  Updated life3d to include shooting gliders.
  BSD and Linux icons slightly modified.  Also new ships for life.
  Compile time options HAS_RAND, HAS_RANDOM, and HAS_RAND48, and
    updated the sccsid so `what` will give you something meaningful.

2.6
  Created a HAS_USLEEP and a USE_VROOT switch.
    There were numerous reports of the incompatibility with tvtwm,
    (also problems with windows with StickyAbove set to true and
    swirl), read the README section on that.
  Thanks to Chris Ross <cross@va.pubnix.com>, maintainer of tvtwm, for
    fixing various bugs; make depend for R5 and less, life3d should not
    have malloc.h, and a time-elapsed patch. 
  A few new life forms for life.c.  Anyone know what SMILEY is really
    supposed to look like?  :)
  Revised -inroot does not lock screen, as this is done better with the
    following patch, and as someone pointed out, its not intuitive.
  Thanks to Tim Medley for sending the -geometry patch of Mike Peercy
    <peercy@crhc.uiuc.edu>.  Many of the modes will fail if the windows
    are far from square or are too small.  You can place Xlock off the
    screen, for example,
      xlock -enablesaver -mode blank -geometry +1152+0
    puts the window off the visible screen on a Sun.
  A new version of flame.c from the original author Scott Graves
    <spot@cs.cmu.edu>.
  Something really devilish for BSD (new icons) thanks to J Wunsch
    <j@uriah.sax.de>, but they have been modified.  I also created a
    Linux icon.
  A patch for Ultrix systems (at least DECstations) running enhanced     
    security thanks to Chris Fuhrman <cfuhrman@vt.edu> and friend.
  Multidisplay bug fix for life3d and wator, thanks to
    <epstein_caleb@jpmorgan.com>.
  Life3d on a monochrome monitor looks a little better. -mono was
    working right.

2.5
  A patch for swirl for fixed color maps (more colorful) and the
    image now spirals outwards from the center with a fixed number of
    points drawn every iteration, thanks to <M.R.Dobie@ecs.soton.ac.uk>.
  A patch for blot on dual-headed machines and nanosleep, thanks to
    Greg Onufer <Greg.Onufer@Eng.Sun.COM>. Use nanosleep on Solaris2.3
    and greater, examine the Imakefile and/or README for details.
  A long needed patch for X11R5+ for -delay, -batchcount, and
    -saturation to work thanks to Patrick D Sullivan <pds@bss.com>.
  bomb mode patch for more flexibility thanks to Dave Shield
    <D.T.Shield@csc.liv.ac.uk>.
  bomb mode patch for Sun10 thanks to Nicolas Pioch <pioch@Email.ENST.Fr>.
  modes wator and life3d added.
  life now has a random soup pattern stolen from life3d.
  -inroot option added, thanks to Bill Woodward <wpwood@pencom.com>.
    Now more compatible with xscreensaver if run as
    "xlock -mode kaleid -inroot -nolock".

2.4
  hopalong now includes a sine hop (but less likely to come up).
  life now has new organisms. They are now better centered.  Some of
   the nonperiodic forms were removed.
   life's gliders now come from the edge of the screen, usually.
  image now centers icons, for example, the hp icon is now centered.
  blot now randomly has xsym, ysym, or both.
  Solaris should now compile out of the box to handle shadow passwords.
    Thanks to Alain Brossard <brossard@siisun.epfl.ch>.
  rock, grav, rect, bat, world, bounce and swirl fix for 24 bit colors.
  Patch for building under HP-UX with Secured Passwords, thanks to
    Dale Harris <rodmur@ecst.csuchico.edu>.

2.3
  Now the X Logo displays if not Sun or HP.
  "bat" mode disastrous bug fixed.  Thanks to R.K.Lloyd@csc.liv.ac.uk
    for pointing it out.
  -DMOUSEMOTION switch added for those who want the Password window to
    come up if you just moved the mouse. (Not recommended).
  "swirl" mode was modified to check background, foreground, and black
    so as not to cycle these colors, special thanks to Mark Dobie
    <mrd@ecs.soton.ac.uk>.
  -DFORCEFIXEDCOLORS switch for those who are annoyed by swirl cycling
    its colors.

2.2
  Made more consistent with the slackware release.  XLock.ad changes
    to rock, rotor, and foreground and background colors.
  Fixed bug in life.c, evident in the Slackware release.
  Minor patch for swirl on HP's due to R.K.Lloyd@csc.liv.ac.uk.
  "bat" put back with minor changes.

2.1
  Large modifications to README.
  Patch for building under QNX 4.2 w/ Metrolink X server, thanks to
    Brian Campbell <brianc@qnx.com>.

2.0
  "swirl" mode was added, thanks to Mark Dobie <mrd@ecs.soton.ac.uk>.
    WOW, but not-so-neat on monochrome monitors.
  Patch for Solaris 2.3 for local, NIS, and NIS+ passwords, thanks to
    <Christian.Iseli@di.epfl.ch>.
  "image" mode was put back but random will not run it, too boring.
  "bomb" mode was added, thanks to <D.T.Shield@compsci.liverpool.ac.uk>.
  In order to use extra-long passwords with the Linux, changed
    PASSLENGTH from 20 to 64.  Thanks to <slouken@virtbrew.water.ca.gov>.

1.14
  Multidisplay bug fix for rect, thanks to <epstein_caleb@jpmorgan.com>.
  Now works on IRIX on the SGI. Thanks to <reggers@julian.uwo.ca>.
  Now works on NetBSD. Thanks to Greg Earle <earle@isolar.Tujunga.CA.US>.
  Now works on a Alpha 3000/400 OSF/1 V2.0. Thanks to Udo Linauer
    <ul@eacpc4.tuwien.ac.at>.
  "galaxy" mode was added, thanks to Hubert Feyrer
    <hubert.feyrer@rz.uni-regensburg.de>.
  "kaleid" mode was added, taken from the Linux version of xkaleid.
  
1.13
  "timeelapsed" option was added.  Allows you to find out how long a
    machine is locked so you can complain to an administrator.
  Now may work on IRIX on the SGI. Thanks to Thomas Runge
    <runge@egd.igd.fhg.de>
  "bat" mode was added, thanks to Lorenzo Patocchi <patol@info.isbiel.ch>.

1.12
  xlock now works on Linux with shadow passwords.  Special thanks to
    H. J. Dihu <macgyver@mcs.com>

1.11
  Shadow passwords and DES encryption are now detected by the Imakefile.
    Victor Langeveld <vic@mbfys.kun.nl> reorganized the Imakefile for 
    shadow passwords and crypt.  Now should compile "right out of the
    box" (although there are still problems on Solaris 2.3).
  Patch to fix sudden rotation changes in rock from Yoshiaki Kasahara
    <kasahara@csce.kyushu-u.ac.jp>.

1.10
  R.K.Lloyd@csc.liv.ac.uk reorganized the Imakefile yet again.
  Fixed a bug in rect.c thanks to <epstein_caleb@jpmorgan.com>.
  Ditched bzero and bcopy since both are more generally available as
    memset and memcpy.  Also removed some lint warnings.

1.9
  "rect" mode was added from xscreensaver's greynetic.
  "helix" bug fixed.  It is now more interesting.
  bounce.c divide by zero fixed and grav.c improvements.  Thanks to Greg
    Bowering <greg@cs.adelaide.edu.au>.
  grav.c, rock.c, world.c fixed so no black objects.

1.8
  Imakefile did not work with R6.  Also Solaris2.3 may use SVR4
    instead of SYSV.  Thanks to Chris P. Ross <cross@eng.umd.edu>
  "grav" mode was added.  Its a simplistic gravitational simulation,
    with (currently a constant 16) solid spheres (non-renderd) of equal
    size and mass orbiting a fixed central mass.  The sphere's orbit in
    3 dimensions, their position and size being projected with simple
    perspective.  Thanks to Greg Bowering <greg@cs.adelaide.edu.au>.
  "inwindow" option was added.  Allows you to do what xlock already
    did when DEBUG was defined.  It no longer locks your screen, but
    allows you to run xlock as a (somewhat distracting) decoration.
    Thanks to Greg Bowering <greg@cs.adelaide.edu.au>.
  "bounce" mode (football) is back.
  "world" mode was added.  Thanks to Matthew Moyle-Croft
    <mmc@cs.adelaide.edu.au>
  "image" mode was removed. It was very similar to world anyway.

1.7
  cuserid() is needed by Solaris2.3 with shadow passwords in xlock.c.
    Thanks to Bill <benedett@gentire.com>.

1.6
  R.K.Lloyd@csc.liv.ac.uk pointed out again that gray_bits in maze.c needs
    a type cast.
  xlock.c defaults to "blank" to minimize cpu usage on a network.

1.5
  xlock works again on VMS (see README.VMS) thanks to Anthony Clarke
    <Anthony.D.Clarke@Support.Hatfield.Raytheon.bae.eurokom.ie>.
  memcpy and memset definitions for SYSV. Also there now is a switch
    for shadow passwords thanks to <reggers@julian.uwo.ca>.

1.4
  Now works on BSD. Thanks to Victor Langeveld <vic@mbfys.kun.nl>
  Both Victor and Alexandre Miguel <miguel@natacha.ens-cachan.fr>
    suggested taking out the cuserid() call in xlock.c.  For FreeBSD its
    a necessity and the old way is is a security hole in SunOS.

1.3
  Linux port from Darren Senn's (sinster@scintilla.capitola.ca.us) xlock.
  Fixed drand to random in helix.c
  Fixed a memory leak in rock.c.

1.2
  SHIFT - CONTROL - BREAK on the HP is trapped. Thanks to
  R.K.Lloyd@csc.liv.ac.uk who pointed out that this was done in xscreensaver.
  AIXV3 and HP bugs fixed, again due to R. K. Lloyd.

1.1 & 1.0
  took out "rint" from "worm.c" since HP's have trouble with it
  added spline, maze, sphere, hyper, helix, rock, & blot modes.
  fixed "xlock.h" and "usleep" for the HP.
  changed border so it varies with size of screen on "swarm" so the
    wasp would not be stuck in a corner when the password is entered.
