Here is the latest version of xlock, which incorporates several
enhancements and some bug fixes.  It now prompts the user for the
password rather than providing no feedback as in the last version.  It
also queries the defaults database for all options that are accessible
through the command line.  So lines like "xlock.font: fixed" in your
~/.Xdefaults will do the right thing.  The files XCrDynCmap.c and
XCrHsbCmap.c are good examples of correct use of synamic colormap
generation and manipulation of HSB linear color ramps.

There is also a copy on expo.lcs.mit.edu:~/contrib/xlock.shar.Z
